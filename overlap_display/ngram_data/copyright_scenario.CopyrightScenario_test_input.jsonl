There's an intense interest on preparing good homilies, they get the best music they can get, they're very hospitable. And they really do have a plan for evangelization, they enter into mission, and they have a vision and structure for moving beyond the doors of the church.\" Prayer and the Eucharist are also central to thriving parishes, as Simon points out in his book. St. Mary's parish has a 24-hour adoration chapel, accessible by code. \"The Eucharist is the source of unity for the parish; is is the supreme action that unites all who experience it to Christ and to the prayer and tradition of the universal Catholic community,\" Simon wrote. **Catholicism in the city: Ecclesial Movements** Another popular form of community within the Catholic Church, particularly in the post-Vatican II years of the 20th and 21st Centuries, has been Ecclesial Movements. These include groups such as Opus Dei, Focolare, or the Neocatechumenal Way. In e-mail comments to CNA, Dreher said that he did not know enough about Ecclesial Movements to say whether or not they could constitute a \"Benedict Option.\" But they seem to have markedly different philosophies when it comes to living the Christian life in the world. Ecclesial Movements seek to re-engage the laity in their faith and to evangelize the world. They include a variety of charisms, educational methods and apostolic forms and goals, and while they have local bases, they are not geographically bound to one location. Many have a presence in countries throughout the world. Holly Peterson is the director of communications for Communion and Liberation, one such ecclesial movement that was founded by Italian priest Fr. Luigi Giussani. As a young priest in 1950s Italy, where basically everyone went to Mass and Catholic school, Fr. Giussani began to realize that the faith didn't actually mean anything to the real, lived experiences of the young students he was teaching. They went through the motions of the faith, but they didn't seem to know what it meant to really live a Christian life. \"He later defined it by saying that he had this question in him - have the people left the church? Or has the church left the people?\" Peterson told CNA. Fr. Giussani started taking his students on retreats and excursions in the mountains so that he could teach them how to live an authentically integrated life of faith - much in the style of Pope John Paul II, a close friend of Giussani and the movement. \"He understood that...he needed to introduce them to life, because through their experience of life they would begin to understand who God was, who Christ was,\" Peterson said. As his students grew up and continued following his teachings, a movement was born. Membership in Communion and Liberation is freely given - there's no registration or membership requirements, and there are many different levels of association, but a standard commitment is attendance at the weekly meetings, called School of Community. School of Community is more than just a meeting, Peterson said. It's a chance for catechesis, for members to be spiritually fed, but also for them to develop Christian friendships that grow outside of the official meetings. Members form strong friendships and communities that carry on outside of the weekly meetings. They go out to dinner, help each other with babysitting, have parties, and just live life together. The movement also has consecrated lay men and women - called Memores Domini - who live in community but work in the secular world. There are doctors, rocket scientists, secretaries, teachers and many other kinds of professions found amongst the members. But regardless of the level of association, CL members have a markedly different way of viewing the world than the Ben-Oppers. \"We're not afraid of doom and gloom around the corner, not to say that that's wrong, but that's not our style,\" Peterson said. \"Instead we desire to dive into the deep end of the pool. We want to be present where people are suffering, we want to do what Pope Francis has called us to do, which is to go to the periphery.\" \"And the periphery isn't necessarily skid row of L.A., though that is the periphery as well,\" she added. \"My periphery could be my workplace, where everyone might live a pessimism that's so thick and so sad, where they have absolutely zero hope in front of the reality that we live.\" The Community of the Beatitudes, founded in France, is another active ecclesial movement. Like the name implies, they strive to live the teachings of the Beatitudes within their community. Their charism is Eucharistic and Marian, and in the Carmelite tradition. The community has consecrated brothers and sisters, as well as several hundred lay members and friends at various levels of association, that are active throughout the world. In the beginning, lay members lived in community with the consecrated members in huge monasteries in Europe that allowed each vocation to have it's own separate wing. But more recently, the Vatican told the community that the lay members must not live directly with consecrated members. \"Rome said lay must be real lay, you don't stay set apart,\" Sr. Mary of the Visitation, a member of the community in Denver, told CNA. \"So obviously they are lay people, they receive the spirit and the charism of the community, they are full members of the community, they're fully part of the liturgy, but they live in the world.\" The Community of the Beatitudes, much like Communion and Liberation, quickly spread all over the world. Their apostolates serve the immediate needs of their surrounding communities in various ways - schools, hospitals, catechesis - rather than focusing on one particular type of ministry. Members and friends of the movement regularly come together for meals, liturgy, faith formation and service. Sr. Mary of the Visitation said that while her community anchors her, she desires to invite more people to live a life following the Beatitudes. Although rooted in prayer, \"we live in the world,\" she said. \"So if I'm going for a walk in the neighborhood, I will meet people, obviously when they see my habit they will think about God, but then we can have a conversation and go deeper.\" Sr. Mary said that on the one hand, she understands the Benedict Option desire to preserve the good, and to separate oneself from evil. Preserving oneself from too much T.V., or other inappropriate media, is a good thing, she said. But she also worries that the Benedict Option may look at those in the world as \"other,\" rather than as brothers and sisters. \"What I dislike in this idea, is that it would mean that the world is bad, and the Benedictine Option is good. But we're not in a movie with the bad and the good. We are in the reality of life, where the world is within me, and this is the most difficult part is to convert myself,\" she said. \"And I really think that my brothers and sisters from the world, I cannot judge them, I cannot be separate from them, because I don't want to go to heaven without them.\" There have been concerns among some that ecclesial movements are taking the place of the parish in members' lives. But lived properly, Peterson said, that's not the case - movements should serve to strengthen parish communities. \"We try to be very engaged in the parish for that reason,\" she said, \"doing charitable work, teaching in parish schools, a lot of musicians in the movement are active in their parishes.\" Ultimately, she said, \"I think these movements are the way that God is rejuvenating the Church...movements are called to give people life so that they can live in this crazy world here.\" **Share this article** Original article with sharing options: Link FEATURES **These 17th-century monks did a beer fast for Lent** _by Matt Hadro (CNA/EWTN News) • March 1, 2017_ (Africa Studio via Shutterstock) **Washington D.C.**--As Ash Wednesday kicks off the Lenten season, Catholics enter into 40 days of abstaining from sweets, technology, alcohol and other luxuries. But did you know that Catholic monks once brewed beer specifically for a liquid-only Lenten fast? Back in the 1600s, Paulaner monks moved from Southern Italy to the Cloister Neudeck ob der Au in Bavaria. \"Being a strict order, they were not allowed to consume solid food during Lent,\" the current braumeister and beer sommelier of Paulaner Brewery Martin Zuber explained in a video on the company's website. They needed something other than water to sustain them, so the monks turned to a common staple of the time of their region - beer. They concocted an \"unusually strong\" brew, full of carbohydrates and nutrients, because \"liquid bread wouldn't break the fast,\" Zuber noted. This was an early doppelbock-style beer, which the monks eventually sold in the community and which was an original product of Paulaner brewery, founded in 1634. They gave it the name \"Salvator,\" named after \"Sankt Vater,\" which \"roughly translates as 'Holy Father beer,\"' Zuber said. Paulaner currently serves 70 countries and is one of the chief breweries featured at Munich's Octoberfest. Although its doppelbock is enjoyed around the world today, it had a distinctly penitential origin with the monks. Could a beer-only fast really be accomplished? One journalist had read of the monks' story and, in 2011, attempted to re-create their fast. J. Wilson, a Christian working as an editor for a county newspaper in Iowa, partnered with a local brewery and brewed a special doppelbock that he consumed over 46 days during Lent, eating no solid food. He had regular check-ups with his doctor and obtained permission from his boss for the fast, drinking four beers over the course of a work day and five beers on Saturdays and Sundays. His experience, he said, was transformative - and not in an intoxicating way. Wilson learned \"that the human body is an amazing machine,\" he wrote in a blog"], "id": "id628"}, "stats_key": {"light_scenario_key": {"scenario_spec": {"class_name":

Too much at one time.\" States a confused Gladiator. \"Gladiator, just please go help unload the equipment and gear, while I measure.\" Hack walks forward, while everyone else is busy unloading their gear. Chapter Six The helicopter is completely unloaded and everyone, including Kain, is standing behind Hack. Everyone's waiting to see what he's going to do with the Stone of Awareness that they took from the villager, a.k.a. 'boy'. Hack is holding the stone. \"I'm pretty sure that we are far enough back out of harm's way. Are you ready and you know what to say when I give you the cue, right?\" Rugged replies, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's get this show on the road already.\" Hack steps forward a step, to the mark he had previously made on the ground. He holds the stone upward toward the bright blue sky. \"Ra-ja-ka. Stone of Awareness reveal to us what has been hidden, reveal to us the tomb of King Foymama!\" As Hack holds the stone upward, the sky darkens and fills with clouds. Lightning flashes across the sky and thunder echoes as the wind picks up. With the loudness of the wind and thunder, Hack must yell to Rugged. \"Now! Say the words!\" Rugged steps forward, \"Mauma sai mauma sai oh ahahah!\" He keeps repeating the phrase. The ground starts to shake. The villager is trembling so much that he grabs hold of Xiona tightly. She doesn't seem bothered by his clutch. Everyone else seems to be keeping their cool. Slowly, but at an increasing rate, the temple is being revealed, as if an invisible blanket was being withdrawn. \"Now I've seen almost everything.\" Zarr states, as Razz stands speechless. Almost everyone looking at the mostly revealed tomb seems speechless, except Rugged who manages, \"Wow, talk about massive.\" Finally the tomb is completely visible, yet the sky above it is covered with darkness. The line Hack made in the dirt is almost lined up with the visible line where darkness and light meet. The violent elements are somewhat subdued. \"Trippy.\" Gladiator mutters as he looks down at the line. Suddenly, wearing her form fitting jet black ninja outfit and armed with tools of the trade, Shadow sprints off into the darkness toward the tomb. \"What the hell is she doing?\" Explode exploded. Xiona yells \"Shadow!\" But to no avail, Shadow was already passing through the temple entrance. \"What's going on with her?\" Razz asks. \"Yeah, why she'd do that?\" Zarr questions. All questioning eyes turn toward Hack. \"Like I know. Everybody's guess is as good as mine.\" Explode yells, \"Well I'm not gonna stand around here all day while she grabs all the good shit!\" \"First time for everything, but I agree with Explode. Let's go.\" Rugged agrees. \"OK. I have the maps of the tomb printed out. Here are copies for everyone. We can keep open communication with these walkie-talkies. I have one for each of you, but we shouldn't be separated in the first place. This is just in case one of you decides to run off on a wild goose chase, a.k.a. Shadow. There are only two paths that you'll discover as soon as we are inside. One leads to the treasure room and the other path, who knows. But again, I'm pretty sure one or more of you will want to explore the unknown.\" \"Enough talk, I wanna rock n roll now.\" Bebida said. Explode agrees, \"Then let's fucking go!\" He flips on the infrared scope on his gun. Explode's infrared turns off as soon as he crossed the line between darkness and light. \"What the fuck?\" he yells. Other members of the group experience the same as they crossed over. Hack explains that since the tomb is sealed in time, anything that was not conceivable during that time period probably won't work. Razz states, \"Yeah makes sense but don't you think it's quite odd that the only person who didn't bring any device of the sort ...\" Zarr continues, \".... runs into the tomb like a bat out of hell as soon as the tomb was completely revealed?\" Razz and Zarr look at each other, \"Hmmm.\" Tripwire adds, \"They do have a point.\" Bebida agrees with them, \"They sure do, and now what are we supposed to do with all this equipment, it's useless.\" Hack, trying to make the best of out of a bad situation, \"Well we can empty out all the bags or anything that carried something and use it to carry out artifacts. Plus rope and some other stuff are not useless.\" Rugged asks, \"So we just gonna leave everything here?\" Explode erupts, \"This is bullshit. I tell you what we should do with it. We should shove it up Kain's ass. I bet you Shadow is the fucking mole. The Host said he hired her. I bet you, they knew all along that this was gonna happen. That's why she fuckin' high- tailed it out of here so fast.\" Hack tries to rationalize with him, \"Calm down big guy. Don't you realize that you've blamed almost everyone of being in on some kind of conspiracy? Don't you see that Xiona's theory is probably right? The Host said that to plant distrust.\" Explode is beyond reasoning, \"Fuck you! Fuck Xiona! Fuck Kain! Fuck Shadow! And fuck The Host.\" The last comment has finally received a rouse out of the normally quiet Kain, who points at Explode, who is about 20 yards away. \"Your mouth defiles you, insignificant bug. Kain ordered not to kill any of you but Kain is known to disobey orders Kain not like. So watch your tongue speaking about the Host. Take heed, you have been warned and Kain only warns once.\" Kain's voice was so deep and threatening that the birds and other animals in the surrounding area can be either seen or heard fleeing. \"Oh shit,\" mumbles Zarr\" Now you've done it.\" Razz adds. The look on Explode's face reveals that he's even shocked that Kain spoke, but he holds his stance, \"What will you do about it?\" Kain removes one of his gloves. He reaches down and picks up a rock about the size of a soda can. Kain's hand is so massive that only a small portion of the rock can be seen through his grip. He starts to squeeze the rock. The flames in his eyes glow brighter and the veins in his muscular arm start pulsating. Suddenly, steam starts to come from the visible part of the rock. A red glow emanates from his hand. The rock explodes. Kain didn't budge. \"Uh.... I think he answered your question,\" Bebida says, who had pulled down his shades during this display to assure that his eyes were not deceiving him. Kain, with not even one bead of sweat, stands staring at Explode. Explode visibly calmer, says to the group, \"Grab some torches, I mean branches, so we can make torches.\" He then grabs a couple of bags and heads off into the darkness. Still in shock of what they just witnessed, slowly and pretty much one by one, each member grabs their usable gear and/or branches and head into the darkness leading to the tomb. Rugged says to Hack as he walks by, \"I've got the villager.\" Hack doesn't acknowledge him. Xiona walks over and grabs him by the arm, \"Come on, let's go.\" Hack asks her in an almost whisper, \"What the hell is he?\" Xiona shakes her head, \"I don't know\" Xiona and Hack, the last two to depart, head into the darkness together. ##Chapter Seven The expedition, minus Shadow, heads down the poorly lit main hallway connecting the entrance to the ingress of the tomb. Lined up on each side of the corridor are magnificently detailed stone statues of ancient tribesmen and between each is a lit torch. Gladiator asks, \"How is it that these torches are still lit after so many years? Flames don't usually last that long.\" Hack replies, \"I think it has something to do with the tomb being sealed in time. Who knows, if that is the case we might even run into a few servants or even the King himself.\" \"So there might be people running around in here unaware of the fact that they are stuck in here and stuck in some horrible time loop?\" Bebida asked. \"Possible but not likely. Foymama was very paranoid and trusted on a select few. After the tomb was completed, anyone found within so many feet of the tomb was executed on sight. You didn't need to be inside the tomb,\" explains Xiona\" Good, no unexpected greeters.\" Rugged adds. \"Can't agree with you. I hope there is one particular individual here. Taxa.\" \"Taxa the Weapon-Master?\" Zarr asks. \"The woman-beast?\" Razz also asks. \"So you've heard of her?\" Xiona queries to the twins. \"What treasure hunter hasn't? Story is that this half woman, half Minotaur would go country to country and challenge their best warriors ...\" Razz said. \"...and she would fight any opponent with a weapon of their choice. The winner would get the magnificent weapon that had to be put up beforehand ...\" Zarr added. \"...and she would only fight if the weapon was mythical or had supernatural powers.\" Hack said. \"Rumor is she never lost,\" acknowledges Rugged. Xiona states confidently, \"And she never fought me.\" \"Ha!\" Explode laughed. Before Xiona can comment on Explode's laughter, Bebida asks, \"and why would she be here?\" Hack answers, \"Because she was a beast summoned by Foymama to win for him these weapons. She is his servant.\" Xiona seems impressed that everyone seems to know so much about Taxa. Gladiator asks, \"So Xiona, you really think you can beat her?\" \"I wouldn't have taken the invite if"], "id": "id848"}, "stats_key": {"light_scenario_key": {"scenario_spec": {"class_name":

Rather it is 'what Allah Alone wills.' \"Ibn Majah reported from Tufail (May Allah be pleased with him) 'Aishah's brother from her mother's side, that he narrated: I had a dream in which I carne upon a group of Jews and said to them, \"You are indeed a good people had you not claimed Uzair (May Allah be pleased with him) the son of Allah.\" Then they said, \"You too are good if you do not say: 'What Allah may will and Muhammad may will.' After that, I carne upon a group of Christians and said to them, \"You are indeed a good people if you do not claim Christ, the son of Allah,\" then they said, \"You too are good if you do not say: 'What Allah may will and Muhammad may will.\"' Then the following morning, I narrated the above event to some, and carne to the Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him). and repeated the whole event. He (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) asked,\" Have you told this to anybody else?\" I said, \"Yes\", Then he (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) went to his pulpit and after offering praises to Allah said, \"Tufail had a dream which he already had communicated to some of you, You used to say a sentence which due to some hesitation (that Allah did not reveal in this regard) I could not prevent you from, Henceforth, do not say: 'What Allah may will and Muhammad may will' but say: 'What Allah may will Alone.' \"Important issues of the Chapter 1) The Jews were aware of the consequences of minor Shirk. 2) Man's understanding of the Shirk if he wishes to. 3) The statement of the Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) \"Have you\" \" made me an associate with Allah.\" How condemnable is the poet who said:\" O noblest of the creatures, there is none for me but you to seek refuge in distress.\" 4) This is not the major Shirk as the Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) said: \"I was prevented from doing so for such and such ...\" 5) A true dream is a kind of revelation. 6) The sound and true dream may be reason for initiating some rulings in the Shari'ah.\" \" CHAPTER No: 45 Whoever curses Time has wronged Allah Allah the Almighty said:\" And they say: There is nothing but our life of this world, we die and we live and nothing destroys us except Ad-Dahr (the time). And they have no knowledge of it, they only conjecture.\" (45:24) Narrated Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) said:\" Allah said, 'The son of Adam wrongs me for he curses Ad-Dahr (the time); though I am Ad- Dahr (the Time), in My Hands are all things, and I cause the revolution of day and night.\" (Al-Bukhari) In another version wherein it is said:\" Do not abuse Ad-Dahr (the time); for Allah is Ad-Dahr\". Important issues of the Chapter 1) Cursing Ad-Dahr (the time) is forbidden. 2) Abusing Ad-Dahr (the time) is in fact to wrong Allah. 3) Contemplation of the statement of the Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) \"Verily Allah is Ad-Dahr\". 4) Something may be an abuse even if such was not the heartfelt intention (of the abuser).\" \" CHAPTER No: 46 To be named \"Judge of Judges\" and the like Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) said:\" The most perfidious (awful/meanest) name to Allah is (that of) a man calling himself Malik Al-Amlak (the king of kings). In fact, there is no king but Allah\". (Al-Bukhari) Sufyan said, \"Another example is the title of Shahanshah.\" In another version:\" Allah will be most enraged on the Day of Judgement, and the most wicked (will be a man who has given himself the title of 'king of kings')\" And the word Akhna' (May Allah be pleased with him) means \"lowest, meanest,\" (Auda (May Allah be pleased with him)). Important issues of the Chapter 1) Prohibition of applying the title 'king of kings' to anyone. 2) Prohibition of applying any other similar connotation as in the example given by Sufyan (May Allah be pleased with him) 3) Comprehension and understanding of the gravity of the Prophet's saying despite that one may not intend the ugly or worst meaning of it in his heart. 4) Realization and understanding this account of Allah being Most High and Unapproachable in His Greatness and without any shortcomings (unlike the worldly 'king').\" \" CHAPTER No: 47 Respect for the Names of Allah and changing one's name for the sake of that It is narrated from Abu Shuraih (May Allah be pleased with him): His Kunyah (nickname) was Abul-Hakam. So the Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) once said to him, \"Allah is Al-Hakam (the Judge); and His Judgement is to prevail.\" Then Abu Shuraih said, \"My people come to me for adjudication of their disputes; and when I judge between them, both parties are pleased with my judgement.\" The Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) rejoined, \"How excellent is this! Do you have any children?\" I said, \"Yes, Shuraih, Muslim and Abdullah.\" Then the Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) asked, \"Who is the eldest?\" I said, \"Shuraih,\" then the Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) said, \"You are henceforth to be called Abu Shuraih.\" Abu Dawud and other collectors have mentioned this Hadith in their books.

Say: 'Was it at Allah (May Allah be pleased with him) and His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) that you were mocking?' \"(9:65) Ibn Umar, Muhammad bin Ka'b, Zaid bin Aslam and Qatadah ((May Allah be pleased with him)) narrated the following Hadith: In the course of the campaign of battle Tabuk, a man carne up one day and declared: \"We have seen no people with greater appetite, more lying, more cowardly in battle than those people,\" he meant Allah's Messenger (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) and his Companions. Awf bin Malik rose and said, \"In fact, you are the liar and a hypocrite (Mundfiq) and I will inform Allah's Messenger (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) about your words.\" So he went

Yrant would do fei job. Fei always did. Even in the darkness of the bedchambers where there were no inhibitions. ##A red light flashed urgently on his personal comp. He leaned over with a languid hand and pressed the 'retrieve' key. He glanced at the words and reread them again. ##He slammed the comp shut. ##Four war-cruisers were heading towards Artia. ##And indeed, the silver ships emerged from a spinning interstellar whirlpool, four sleek-shaped and armed leviathans moving in like killer orcas of old, intent on the hunt. #Chapter Seven Min Feng needed to grab hold of Javen before he headed back to Mesa Academy for another semester. He had been busy ever since they came back from his slot canyon, helping his mother harvest bundles of desert sage and assorted herbs. She made a point of looking out for him once she had finished her chores for the day and if Aunt Betta was willing, was free to walk around the small town they were living in. The dreams had been troubling her. Javen had been tight-lipped when it came to her _nei huo_ and shied away from talking about it when she tried to broach the topic everytime. She had to make him understand that the _nei huo_ was not a disease to be scared of. Nor was it destructive enough to turn her into some mythological monster. It was a gift, as many of her aunts and her mother would say, and not something to be feared. And like all gifts, it had to be kept and treasured. It was also part of who she was. Her heritage. She could not deny her heritage as much as he could his. He had seen her shift before and it had no doubt etched a permanent mark in him. Part of him _knew_ what she was. He was that intuitive. Another part however denied it and put it away. _Out of mind, out of sight_, as Bei would say. She was not going to walk around with an imagined stigma. She chanced upon Javen hanging the herbs out to dry. His back was facing her as he carefully hung the crinkly bundles on the wooden racks. The evocative smell of sage pervaded the air. \"Javen?\" Min Feng said and she smiled when he turned around. He was bare-chested and she was well aware of the sinewy musculature beneath his brown skin. Oh, yes. _That_. So far they had only kissed and held hands. \"Min,\" he smiled, flashing even white teeth, before he took a swig at a bottle of water. \"You done with your studies for the day?\" She nodded and searched for words in her head. She thought she came prepared. Apparently, the words had all absconded, leaving her lost and bewildered. \"We need to talk,\" she began and mentally knocked herself. _Now, that sounded tooserious, didn't it? _ She was a trader. A _merchant_, for Heavens' sake. She should have the gift of words. At the moment, the art of persuasion eluded her. \"Is anything wrong?\" Javen asked, his face worried. \"Are you all right?\" \"No, no. I am fine. I just need to talk about my phoenix flame.\" _There_. The invisible shields immediately rose up like barricades. Javen clamped his lips together and turned resolutely back to the herbs rack. \"Javen, you are not going to run away from this issue, because it _concerns_ me and _is_ a part of me,\" Min Feng pressed on determinedly. \"I am not a monster. The phoenix flame is my heritage. My ancestors had it. My family has it. I have it.\" He did not say anything. The bundles bobbed in the breeze, sending intermittent whispers of fragrance. \"It is not a disease, not a blood _disorder_,\" Min Feng could see the chords on his back tightening. \"You are training to be a doctor. You should know.\" Javen glanced at her sharply. \"It is the unknowns I am worried about, Min.\" \"That I would end up hurting someone.\" She said flatly. He turned back to the herbs. Min Feng stepped forward and placed her hand on his bare back. She could feel muscles twitching spasmodically beneath her palm. \"I admit that when I was at the nunnery, I almost burned it down. The statues all melted. I charred the entire exercise ground. But I am changed now. I have controlled it, Javen. Please do not be afraid of me.\" That last sentence was a silent plea. _Please look at me, Javen. Look at me. I am standing right in front of you. I am real._\" Min ...\" Javen's reply was softer than she'd expected. \"I am not...afraid of you. I am afraid of the power _inside_ you.\" Silence. It hung between them like a laden weight. Gently, tentatively, Min Feng rested her head against the warm skin smelling of the sun and spicy cologne. _His scent_, she thought. _I will always remember it._ He did not stiffen and for that, she was glad. It was better than outright rejection. \"I know you are no monster. I am just...afraid of the consequences if it is out of control. That's all.\" His voice was like honey. Amber-gold. She drank it up. \"A part of me,\" she murmured and she knew he heard her. \"A part of me.\" \"I know.\" \"I _am_. No pretense. No hiding. And you haven't seen me shift for a while now.\" She carefully circled his torso with her arms. Javen swallowed and clasped her hands, pressed them against his chest. \"I promised myself that I would not hurt anyone. Anyone. Not even you.\" She touched the skin before her with tender lips. \"Not even you.\" _Are you sure? _ Unspoken words. Javen did not respond. Min Feng inhaled his musk. She had said her piece. She was surprising how drained she'd felt. She gently tugged at his hands, pulling her arms away. \"I won't hurt you.\" She said. A promise. A vow. Without a sound, she walked away. Javen waited until her footsteps had faded away before turning around. He held a sage bundle in his hand. \"No, Min. I am afraid you might end up hurting yourself.\" Just then, one of the sage bundles became loose and scattered in the breeze. The desert air current whipped the dry twigs into little swirling eddies. *** Yrant listened to the conversations just as _fei_ had done when _fei_ was a child. So rich, so layered, so informative. _Fei_ stored them avidly, for later use. Very tasty. The kitchen was such a valuable place. The things being served in there...and it was not only the food. Gossip. Vents. Rants. Especially gossip. Tiny little tantalizing hooks, revealing bits about their speakers and the one they were talking about. _Fai_ was well known for their gossip and the many intrigues it would and did transpire. Gossip would lead to _fai_ joining with other _fai_ in social alliances or being sold at the market as chattel. _So, so_. Apparently, warships had been sent to Artia. Hints of a potential conflagration? Oh, the Empress loved this particular dish. _Note taken_. She liked the crystal buns with the chopped chives? Oh, definitely! She has requested it again. Good, good! _Ah, I will remember this_. The princess Min Feng has been gone for a long time. Yes. _The heir-apparent. Another layer. This is delicious._ _Fei_ added a pinch of sea salt into the broth _fei_ was making. It was a seafood broth, with cooked clams opened up like little pink butterflies and red crustaceans with bristly feelers and claws. The cook beside _fei_ regarded _fei_ curiously. \"You are new.\" \"I just joined the kitchen. I came from the rural town of _– going_ _through memory data_ – Yashid.\" Yrant answered and _fei_ was pleased that the cook – a good-looking young man – was satisfied with _fei_ answer. _Fei_ knew that _fei_ had come across as female and the young man was responding to the perceived femininity. Shy boyish admiration. Not like Julian's frank and very masculine sexual appraisal. Yrant frowned. _Fei_ hated thinking about personal things when _fei_ was working on a mission. Very distracting. *** The four Imperial Fleet ships remained motionless above Artia while the Phoenix Court envoy argued his case with the administrator of the planet. Lady Elizabeth Stern-Aus was obstinate and refused to budge. While the envoy tried to explain the Phoenix Court's actions, the lady administrator had already made up her own mind. Beside her, her son offered words of advice. The envoy found his presence oddly disturbing. #Chapter Eight Like all new visitors to Artia, the envoy had an instant dislike of the place. Sunless, extremely industrial, the awful feeling of being hemmed in all directions. He could hardly wait to return back to the Imperial City, where at least the air was not stale and he could feel _free_. The Artians were strange, no doubt products of this unforgiving world. Most of them had pale skin; many were albinos. No sun, a world in perpetual darkness. How terrible. Even the formidable-looking Lady Stern-Aus had milky skin and hair a washed-out blonde. Or was it already white? The envoy knew that, as a diplomat trained to conduct cordial and civil relations with other planets or races, he had to be empathetic to their needs and hear them out. Dialogue was crucial. Yet, he confessed that the physical appearance of the Artians perturbed him to a great degree. Perhaps, indeed, the Phoenix Court had truly ignored these seemingly fragile people. He truly believed that the Artians would turn around and re-establish the quartz supply route. He should convince the Empress that the Artians deserved something better like an array of solar panels to bring in more light and brighten the whole place up with cheer. His accommodations were suitably lavish, given such a spartan environment. The Artians loved to flaunt their wealth indoors. His room had red velvet chairs and a large velvet bed with fur rugs as blankets. They had provided him with a silver tray replete with a decanter of red wine and three crystal wine goblets. Now, the envoy enjoyed fine things and he poured some of the red wine into one of the goblet, admiring the color"], "id": "id909"}, "stats_key": {"light_scenario_key": {"scenario_spec": {"class_name":

I really enjoyed collaborating with some wonderful writers on this collection. And of course there's a new Titus story in the pipe line. And last is a very short tongue in cheek guide for parents of stroppy teenagers called \"Parents' Rules.\" Who is publishing them? All my books are self-published. Where is your favorite place to write? I usually write at my dining table. Yes, I know very unexciting aren't I? What do you listen to when you write? Nothing, I get too distracted if I listen to music or anything else while writing. I even tune out my other half, in fact he just said something that made me realize he'd been out, come back in and I didn't know he'd been gone. Not sure that makes any sense, but hey ho onwards and upwards. How long have you been writing? Oh, I've been writing since childhood but only about fifteen year seriously. If you could be any mythological creature, what would it be and why? That's easy I'd love to be Scheherazade, the storyteller in Arabian Nights. How cool would it be to write 1,001 books that everyone read. What is your guilty pleasure food? The Indian dish: Chicken Biryani, yum! Where can we buy your books? You can find all my books on Amazon both US and UK. Do you have any advice for aspiring writers? Always carry a notebook; you never know where an idea for a story will come from. In the early days I got caught out many times with nothing to write on and lost the idea before I could write it down. I also keep a notebook by my bed, I can't tell you how often and idea pops into my head just as I'm drifting off to sleep. And finally, write, write, write, it doesn't matter if you think it's rubbish; sooner or later you'll have a good story down, and like all aspects of life if you don't use it, you lose it. Thank you, and fyi here's a link (my authors page on Amazon) it lists my books, blog, twitter, website, youtube book promos, etc...where people can find me if they so wish: http: //tinyurl.com/8ygnts Carol Wills Name and about myself My name is Janice Abel. I am educator and bring experiences in teaching, counseling, and administration to my fiction writing. Previous writing has been in a specialized field of college student services. What do you write and past and current releases. I especially like writing fantasy short stories, though recently I have been spending my writing time completing a romance novel. My fantasy stories include two Christmas stories for youth that have appeared as a newspaper serial and are now available as an e-book on Amazon.com \"The Little White Christmas Horse,\" and \"Little Horse Wears Antlers.\" I have several e-books available through Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble. Current releases are \"Beam Down Scotty\", \"Time Rides the Tide,\" and \"The Metallic Bird.\" Forthcoming short stories are \"Silver Stars on the Sea\" and \"The Green Phone.\" Currently I am working on a romance novel and it is hot on every word I write!!! I am excited about this new avenue of genre and you will be hearing more about that very soon. Who is Publishing my work? Essentially I am. Bookrix.com will be doing some of the releases, but with the opportunities for e-books and good work in paper backs, quite frankly, I am not ready to step to a small press with its many problems. Obviously, if a leader in published was chasing me, I would reconsider.:) I am finding my niche as I would encourage others to do. Advice to aspiring writers. Write. Read. Put the pen to the paper. I see any creative endeavor as both a craft and art. The craft is in mastering the tools of the trade- that takes discipline and practice. The art is the creative aspect that takes patience, hanging loose and trying different things, dreaming, and stretching oneself beyond the box in which one lives. The two are very different from one another, so it is important to learn your personal ebbs and flows; that is, the rhythm of blending the two to make your writing an art that flows with energy and interest. A side note- If you ever have writers block you may want to check out my book, \"A Desperate Time\", on Bookrix.com Free to all. On marketing- the fast changing culture will open new doors, so go with the flow, and learn not to get hung up on the details of marketing at the expense of writing your masterpiece!!!! I will finish with a plea. Please buy my e-books or urge at least three of your friends to take a look and buy!!!! How is that for a marketing push!!!!! Search on my Name or Title on Amazon.Com or Barnes & Noble. Best wishes to all writers where ever you are. What is your name? Carolyn Tody ~ Pen names include CactusRose and DreamSculptr. Tell us about yourself. I am probably best described as a late bloomer. I like to paint, dance, write, play with clay, travel, and spend quality time with my growing family. During my career I progressed by studying, earning degrees with the blessing and support of the workplace, networking, learning to take risks, studying with Disney University and in various other locale, and raising my family. By doing so I broke the career 'glass ceiling' enough to get my head above the clouds, and felt proud to hear that others were inspired to become nontraditional students and realize their own dreams. My family is grown and I have a little more freedom to consider dreams that were set aside. In turn, I hope to share that feeling with others in a similar position. What do you write? I primarily write speculative fiction. It often parallels a nonfiction process about realizing one's dreams that is, in turn, based on the notion of serial reinvention. I have also written docudrama, creative nonfiction, nonfiction, and an illustrated book of firelight poetry. Why do you write it? Because I enjoy exercising my imagination and developing stories that deserve an independent life. Writing is one of my passions. I also write to leave legacy for my children and grandchildren. Do you have any past or current releases? Quite a few stories and poems have been published in anthologies under either my name, CactusRose, or as part of DreamSculptr offerings. My first novel is drafted and in the refinement process. Several other stories are part of a longer series in progress, and have contributed to smaller works. Tell us about them. A few true stories relate incredible or mysterious experiences. For instance, surviving the eye of a tornado. Others were surprising steps back in time ~ some to vintage settings where significant incidents occurred 50-years earlier and reunions with elderly owners before they passed. Another was an unplanned conversation 'beyond the curtain' in an unexpected situation - a work setting with my colleagues. \"Music of the Wind\" is a docudrama written to benefit quake victims by reenacting the world's second most powerful earthquake the from the perspective of children. \"Falling for Fall\" is a nostalgic play on photography. Many poems are romanticism geared to finding love again and feeling good about life. Some works feature my artwork. 'Witherworm Villa' stories were created to raise funds for children's charity. A lengthy YA series is underway in a Saga featuring Blackberry Patches, the Patchwork Forest, and a sizable cast. I wrote the first mystique mystery in the 'Guardians of Hope' series during NaNoWriMo and it is in the editing stage. And, since the Saga is taking so long to write, I am preparing for publication as a mini series located at the edge of the Patchwork Forest. Who is publishing them? Writing at the Ledges (www.writingattheledges.com), L. Fairchild, A. Guarnieri, BookRix, the Peacock Writers, and Amazon. Patchwork Treehouse Press will publish the miniseries. Where is your favorite place to write? Facing the living area with scenery outside the windows. I would prefer to add a restless sea with endless water, at a height that lets my imagination soar, and Riviera-like inspiration. What do you listen to when you write? Spa music when I listen to anything; a Mediterranean fountain or real ocean waves would be ideal. How long have you been writing? Like many students, I began writing in childhood. However, I began composing fiction in the early 90's and picked up the pace a few years ago. If you could be any mythological creature, what would it be and why? After a lengthy consultation with my young grandson...a PEGADOR. True, it was a collaboration between a young inventor with a vivid imagination and an author with the heart of a maiden, but this combination of a silver Pegasus, a femme fatale centaur with long flowing hair, and a short-prong unicorn reflects a pure heart with the ability to wing anywhere in the world on land, sea, or in the air, see anything, partake in quests, connect with hearts and heroes in remote locations, all the while defending honor with her quiver, bow, and hidden staff protected by a secret code. Who knows what could happen? What is your guilty pleasure food? Dark chocolate. Where can we buy your books? www.writingattheledges, Amazon.com, and BookRix.com in the near future. The Peacock Writers will be in an expanded market soon. Do you have any advice for aspiring writers? There is such a wealth of information online. Nearly any question can be answered quickly and simply by entering the inquiry in a search engine box and reviewing the responses. Writing groups are also immensely helpful and encouraging with useful experience and feedback. If you can't attend one in person there are online groups that are active night and day. And most importantly, believe in yourself. Practice and elicit constructive comments, but always believe that there are others in the world waiting for what you have to offer.

Dia's heart was still pounding away in her chest, but it wasn't enough to keep her awake. Nor was the shock from the nurse's words. In all honesty, through the frantic thoughts racing through her mind, Dia realized she was probably more lightheaded because she was about to pass out than from the meds they had given her. All because of one little word. Baby. And as the black in her vision spread, her chest gasping for air, Dia had one last thought before she passed out. What baby? #Chapter Six\" I got the information you wanted...and it's not good.\" Stone sat in his dark living room, not needing the light to see the beta of his pack, Caleb, standing across from him, near his front door. His mood was black with the multiple conflicts going on in his life, and he couldn't help snorting in derision at his beta's words. There wasn't much for Stone to like these days, period. First, he'd had problems with Sulphur Springs', the visiting pack, delegate. Negotiations for a truce had gone horribly, and the man had left in such a way that Stone was sure that war was about to be on his doorstep. He had sent Caleb to Sulphur Springs to speak directly to the alpha, asking for another meeting, this time with him personally. Surprisingly, the Sulphur Springs' alpha had agreed, and said he would be here in Battletown as soon as he could make it. As soon as he could make it had turned out to be a week and a half later, which meant he had come back to visit the same day that Dia should have been coming home. The problem was, she never did. That brought him to his next problem. His wolf had been fighting for control from the moment their mate had gone missing. Not that he didn't know where she was now. He did. It had taken him no more than a day to track down her parents' house in Nashville, Tennessee, and find nothing but charred remains. From that point, it had been easy to find out what had happened because it was all over the news. However, the situation had spiraled out of his control from the moment he had stepped foot in the hospital to see her. The police on site there had not so politely told him that he could not see Dia because he wasn't listed as a known contact for her, nor was he a relative. She was under police supervision until they determined whether the explosion was an accident or intentional. At the thought that someone might have purposely tried to hurt her, his wolf had snapped, causing him to lose control of his temper. It escalated to the point that he had punched one of the officers in the face when they wouldn't let him see her. Then they had escorted him off the grounds and told him he was banned from coming back. There he had stood, in another state, unable to see his injured, but thankfully alive mate, and losing his ever-loving mind about it. If that hadn't been bad enough, his beta had called him while he stood just outside of the perimeter of the hospital grounds and delivered another blow. In Stone's haste to find his mate, he had dismissed the visiting Sulphur Springs alpha, and in doing so, insulted him greatly. Not that he gave two fucks about it when it came down to trying to get to his injured mate, which was exactly what he had told Caleb. All of his concentration had been on finding out if his mate was okay. Fucking Caleb had thrown the truth back in his face. Stone needed to care. Otherwise, he might inadvertently start a pack war with the very pack he had been trying to make an ally. It was at that moment that the police officer he had punched pulled up in his patrol car and told him to leave or he would arrest him for assault after all. Stone had no choice but to leave, with only a promise to himself, and his raging wolf, that he would come back soon and find a way in to see Dia. Only, when he had checked into a hotel, shit seemed to spiral out of control again. He had twenty-four hours to come back, meet with the visiting alpha, and apologize, or it would be full-out war between Stone's Battletown Pack and their closest non-human neighbors, the Sulphur Springs Pack. Stone had been left with an unconceivable decision to make: Stay there in Tennessee for his injured mate, or go back to Kentucky and make peace for his pack's sake. Two months later, he still fucking hated himself for leaving his mate that day. Although he had sent three of his most trusted pack members to search over the hospital for any signs of her, and to protect her if need be, it wasn't the same. He should have been there with Dia, and not here in Kentucky dealing with this bullshit, even if he had discovered that it was for her best interests that he had left her. A week after her parents' house exploded, Stone had accomplished two very important things. First, he had made amends with the Sulphur Springs alpha and had secured that alliance. Then the three pack members watching over Dia's hospital reported back with the unthinkable. The Connor's house explosion had been no accident. Someone had purposely set that gas leak so that it would cause an explosion. It was all over the local news there in Tennessee and the human investigators were trying to figure out who had done it. That made Stone wonder: who exactly was the perpetrator trying to kill? Dia's parents, or Dia herself? No matter the answer, Stone had to find out who had done this so he could make sure his mate was safe, and so he could get her justice for losing her parents. That was something Caleb had been helping him with for almost two months now. The problem was, they were having a hard time figuring out who had started the gas leak and why. Now Caleb stood in his living room with an answer, and the hair standing up on the back of Caleb's neck told him Stone wasn't going to like it. \"What is it?\" Stone asked with no preamble. His beta crossed his arms over his chest and shifted his weight from one foot to the other. He was on edge, and had been since they had discovered the attempt made on Dia's life. \"I don't know who exactly, Stone. I've only uncovered why Dia's parents' house exploded.\" A snarl escaped Stone, and he had to reel his wolf back in. He gripped the arms of his chair tight, using all his willpower to keep the powerful beast at bay, when he really wanted to let him loose for bloodshed. \"WHY THEN?\" he snarled out in anger. Caleb uncrossed his arms and ran a hand through his hair. The need to fidget told Stone that his beta was probably battling his own wolf for control, too. \"I was on patrol and behind Old Man Grayson's barn when I heard two feminine voices. They didn't realize I was there because I was downwind. They were talking about the attempt on Dia's life failing and how someone was going to have to finish the job.\" \"Just to be clear, they said her name?\" Caleb shook his head slowly, then said, \"They said 'the alpha's human bitch.' That's how I know they were talking about Dia.\" \"Did you kill them?\" Stone snarled. When Caleb shook his head no, Stone lost all control. His wolf's anger snapped, and the next thing he knew, Stone was across the room, pinning Caleb to a wall by his throat. \"WHY DIDN'T YOU KILL THEM?\" he roared at his beta. Wheezing for air, Caleb choked out, \"Because they heard me coming and disappeared.\" Letting go of Caleb, Stone stepped back and tried to regain his composure. \"What do you mean, they disappeared?\" His beta was rubbing his throat, trying to soothe the spot where Stone had grabbed him. His voice was still rough when he answered, \"I fucked up. Accidentally stepped on a twig that snapped under my paw. They must have heard it, because the next thing I heard was whispered voices and then nothing. By the time I ran around to the other side of the barn, they were gone.\" Running his hands through his hair, Stone growled, \"Why didn't you follow them?\" His beta stilled unnaturally, and then slowly leaned closer to Stone to whisper, \"There was nothing to follow. No visible tracks and no scent. The best I can figure is they were standing in the small stream that runs beside the barn to cover their tracks. What I can't explain is how they left no scent at all.\" \"That's impossible.\" Caleb nodded. \"I know. Even though they could have been standing in the water, it still wouldn't have taken much for the water to bring their scent to the area. Nobody ever escapes without leaving some sort of scent trail. What I want to know, man, is how the hell they did it. Because I'm telling you, Stone, I know what I heard. Those voices were there. So, why weren't they? Or, at least the faintest trace of them?\" Taking numb steps backward, Stone had frantic thoughts whirling through his mind. Disbelief was one of them. How could someone disappear and not leave a scent track? Hunters used other smells to cover their scents, but that wasn't what Caleb had found—or not found, for that matter. His beta hadn't been able to find anything at all. Which seemed impossible. Unless they have a witch. \"Holy fuck, we have a witch on our hands,\" Stone whispered in shock. Caleb's face morphed into one of enraged fury. He hated magic, to the point he was prejudice against it. He had his reasons for it, though. A witch had killed his parents in a spell gone wrong. Balling his fists up by his sides, Caleb let out an angry growl, his lip curling in distaste. \"I"], "id": "id318"}, "stats_key": {"light_scenario_key": {"scenario_spec": {"class_name":

With a child, she had hardly and chance to find a new relationship. Out of frustration she began to eat a lot of sweets, and got overweight after a time. Out of desperation she went on diets, but got even more overweight that way. As is pretty obvious, the solution to her problem would have been simple. She should have eaten more fruit, avoided fat and exercised and practiced positive thinking. Most diets only work for the short term and in the long term produce the opposite effect. When a diet is over, usually one is even hungrier. The best way to get a slimmer figure is to eat healthier and to exercise more. Liselotte didn't have the perseverance for that. She did psycho-therapy and told therapists her problems and they analyzed her childhood. This only made her unhappier. Constantly focusing on problems didn't help her. As the years went by, she felt worse. She needed to concentrate on the positive in life, instead of the problems. She needed to find the way of inner happiness instead of being dependent on good-looking men for happiness. Liselotte didn't need psycho-therapy she needed a consistent spiritual practice. Then she would have gotten happier automatically, and her weight problems would have solved themselves. As a result of being happier and healthier, it would be easier to find and keep an attractive partner, and it not she would still be happier and healthier. If Liselotte had started off correctly with a spiritual practice she would have become a Buddha on the inside instead of the outside. Then she would live in light with or without men. Sometimes psycho-therapy can be helpful, especially when certain problems are being dealt with, such as behavior training and overcoming fears and overcoming specific crisis situations. But in general, the healthiest way is to have a healthy diet and exercise and have a spiritual practice, like praying, doing Yoga, positive thinking in order to get one's life going in the right way. From ta spirtiual perspective, today's psycho-therapy is still wearing baby shoes because it doesn't work holistically. The many psycho-therapeutic schools limit themselves to one technique, whereas the optimal solution to psychic problems is usually a combination of practices and exercises. That holistic approach has been known in Yoga for a long time. Wester psycho-therapy could stand to learn a lot from the old tradition that is Yoga. It is high time that psycho-therapy learnt a thing or two from the treasure trove of knowledge that spirituality already makes use of. When Nils first met Liselotte, she was still very slender. They first met in May, 1980. That was when Nils was getting ready for the birth of his son Florian with his girlfriend at the time. Liselotte was in the same birth preparation course. Nils thought she was a kind person. She had a big smile, despite all her problems. She encountered the birth of her child optimistically. She was looking forward to her child. She was young and pretty, the world lay at her feet. Nils too. Nils and U invited Liselotte to their house. All three got along well. They talked a lot about children, birth and parenthood. Liselotte found Nils kind, but as a man not her type. She knew that, Nils knew that, and U knew that. So U wasn't against Nils meeting Liselotte alone. Their meeting had a special appeal for the two. Nils was allowed to be in the company of a very beautiful woman. And Liselotte knew that Nils wanted her but could not get her. There was a certain spark in the air. Nils could talk about a lot of things with Liselotte. They had a lot of common interests such as the raising of children, relationships, politics, and spirituality. Liselotte thought it was nice to meet someone who liked her visibly. Nils and Liselotte met once a month for seven years. Liselotte still had her troubles with men. She began to eat a lot of sweets and got fatter and fatter. That didn't bother Nils. He liked her both thick and thin. Only Liselotte thought she was unattractive. Because she defined herself mainly by her looks, her weight bothered her a lot, One fall evening, Liselotte was feeling especially bad. All of her efforts to find the right man ended in failure. Her child annoyed her, her job stressed her. There wasn't really anything that made her happy. Nils came to visit and tried to cheer her up. Liselotte knew that she was still an attractive woman to Nils. Why shouldn't she be merciful once to Nils? They both needed comfort, and there was no other man in sight. All moral thoughts fled under the weight of her longing and sadness. Liselotte saw Nils with new eyes. Nils noticed that immediately. He felt the strong sexual energie, that Liselotte sent in his direction. Intense feelings also developed for him. Both slid into a chaos of unfulfilled longing for love and sexuality. The tension between the two built up more and more throughout the evening. They talked, but more they felt the intensity of feelings. Nils only saw the large breasts of Liselotte and her smiling face. He hardly knew what he said and did. His wisdom disappeared. His thinking was dominated by sexual wishes. Nils hadn't slept with U in a long time. The relationship was at an all-time low. Nils was sexually starved, and exactly in that moment Liselotte wanted sex with him. Nils maybe would have resisted if he had a clear understanding of loyalty, but as we already know, Nils hadn't really thought about that topic very much. It took place just some years later as he read a lot of books about relationships and developed some clear ideas about them. The evening came close to an end. The dangerous moment arrived. Should Nils stay or go? Nils looked at Liselotte. Liselotte looked at Nils. She came closer to him. His hands came close to her breasts. He touched her breasts, and Liselotte pressed against Nils. Now it was decided, and both knew it. Liselotte took Nils to her bedroom. Because Nils was overly excited due to pent up sexual energy, it went very fast. It was very unsatisfying for both. Finally, there was just a bland taste left connected with guilty thoughts toward U. The long time friendship was destroyed. They met a few more times, but Liselotte wasn't really interested in Nils anymore. And how did U react to this whole thing? It didn't bother her! She could forgive the two easily. She knew it was a one time situation, because Nils wasn't the right man for Liselotte, so she had no fear of losing him. For that reason she had such a laid-back reaction. Nils and U talked openly and honestly about the incident. They could get over it quickly. But Nils felt really bad. He had made four mistakes, and they were not mistakes that a person with sense should make. The first mistake was to be untrue to U. Disloyalty usually leads to suffering in a relationship. The second mistake Nils had made was to not think of protection during sex. Often when you don't expect to have sex you don't have a condom with you. A second child was not what Liselotte needed, she was already overwhelmed with one child. Nils and Liselotte should have thought of protection, and better should have not even have had sex at all. The third mistake was to not even think or talk about the possibility of infection of a sexually transmitted disease. When two people first have sex, they should absolutely use a condom. AIDS had begun to spread around the world. A condom is the only sure protection if both have not had an AIDS test or had no other partners. Nils had indeed talked about relationships often with Liselotte, but wasn't informed on every detail of Liselotte's relationships. She didn't tell him every detail about every man she had slept with. In this situation, Nils should have used a condom. The fourth mistake Nils made was to even have such a one night stand. Sexuality should generally only occur in the context of an established relationship. In the sixties and seventies, there was a big experiment in the western society. In the student movement, free love was preached. \"those who sleep with the same person twice, already belongs to the establishment.\" The free exchange of sexuality was seen as the main way to happiness. Did this make people happy? It made them unhappy. The ideology of free love proved to be a way to unhappiness. Most people need certainty, trust and reassurance to be able to connect with another. The heart chakra is sensitive. It can bring a person to paradise, but is easily injured. The way of \"free love\" leads to people closing their heart chakra so they don't get hurt by constantly chang8ing partners. It reduces real love, and destroys positive characteristics. This can be seen by all people who follow the way of free love. The egoism grows, the addiction to lust grows, and the dishonesty grows and the self-discipline is reduced. The big sexual revolution was a mistake. We have to decide in life if we want inner or outer happiness. If we take the road to inner happiness, we have to experience our worldly needs carefully. A spiritual person should not practice free love. One needs some wisdom to not lose his or her way in life. The main goal in life should be to find inner happiness. The main goal must be to master life. One should be a Buddha, a Yogi, a saint or an enlightened person. We need to have the right role models if we want to succeed in life. Outer enjoyment should be experienced in the right amount (moderate). Those who are anchored in inner happiness and honest with themselves can tell how much enjoyment they can indulge in. The daily spiritual practice is very important. It keeps us in truth and wisdom. It leads to the ability to observe oneself and to proceed in life with more and more wisdom. Yogi Nils A Yogi Life http: //www.youtube.com/watch? v=sS_n_1a1drE The first four years as a yogi, there was good progress. After Nils had about half a year adjusted to his new situation, defined his goals and found the right spiritual exercises for him, he resolved much old stress and often came in blissful states of consciousness. In his dreams he saw past exam situations, difficult relationships and negative experiences from his childhood. All the stress from his former life disintegrated. His mind became calm, peaceful and happy. One night in 1991 Nils dreamed even of his birth. In the dream, he flowed through a long dark tunnel. He made a birth cry and woke up by it. He breathed like a newborn. Nils had a difficult birth. Thus many tensions arose. These tensions went away now. Later on Nils felt a deep longing to be a baby again. He wanted to be in his mother's womb. That was impossible. But possible was it to be enlightened and to live in a cosmic consciousness, in"], "id": "id366"}, "stats_key": {"light_scenario_key": {"scenario_spec": {"class_name":

All told, it employs around 3,000 non-member employees, making worker-owners a tiny fraction of the total workforce. Potential new members must have worked for the company for five years, be nominated and assessed by other members and pay a membership cost of around $300,000, made as a loan and paid back over fifteen years though salary deductions. Mondragón's use of \"non-member wage labour\" and \"external non-voting capital stakes\" raises [similar issues. Far from economic democracy, all this is reminiscent of the exclusionary practices of medieval craft guilds. Accompanying regulatory strategies could constrain such dynamics. But relying on 'after-the-fact' interventions in political economy is a risky proposition – witness the crisis of social democratic redistributive taxation. To achieve genuinely different outcomes we must look to the deeper engineering of institutional arrangements. It is time to get much more serious about _systemic design_. Systemic Design Fortunately, there _are_ solutions (or the beginnings of them). In Cleveland, Ohio, the Democracy Collaborative has been helping develop a linked group of worker co-ops embedded in overarching community structures. The companies are nested under a community-serving non-profit corporation and return 10 per cent of their annual profits to a revolving fund, the purpose of which is to develop additional co-ops and thereby grow the network. Moreover, the 'Cleveland Model' seeks to incorporate a quasi-public community planning system using the partially protected market of massive purchasing power (over $3 billion a year in goods and services) by large local 'anchors' (hospitals, universities) that are themselves beneficiaries of considerable public support. Such innovations incorporate worker ownership, but also reach beyond to \"the democratisation of wealth and community building in general\". The ills of capitalism do not all reside at the level of the ownership of the firm. Capitalism also operates and impacts at the level of the city, the region, the nation and internationally. Alternatives must do so as well and must include mechanisms and transition strategies for the democratisation of capital at a variety of scales. There has been a great deal of innovative new thinking along these lines in recent years, spurred in part by the failure of traditional social democratic solutions. Alternative system models (or partial models) are now on offer from an array of thinkers, including David Schweickart, Richard Wolff, Gar Alperovitz, Michael Albert, Herman Daly and Erik Olin Wright. For example, in place of the traditional elements of capitalism – private ownership of the means of production with markets in capital, labour, goods and services – Schweickart proposes worker self-management of enterprises and social control of investment. His model has neither capital markets nor labour markets in the usual sense, for the good old-fashioned reason that \"when the market extends beyond goods and services to capital and labor, it begins biting the neighbors, urinating on the carpet, and worse\". Alperovitz sets out the lineaments of a system based on different ownership and growth paradigms he calls the \"Pluralist Commonwealth\":\" \" Pluralist\" to emphasise the priority given to democratic diversity and individual liberty; \"Commonwealth\" to underscore the centrality of new public and quasi-public wealth-holding institutions that take on ever greater power on behalf of the community of the nation as a whole\" This conversation is increasingly sophisticated, but must grow even more so. Such models point past the embrace of one economic institution or another to crosscutting themes of systemic design. Take investment: \"control over investment\", as Adam Przeworski has reminded us, \"is the central political issue under capitalism precisely because no other privately made decisions have such a profound public impact\". At present, decisions about what portion of society's resources should be set aside from consumption and how they should be allocated are treated as private prerogatives. This is particularly objectionable given that finance – the _rentier_ province of the economy _par excellence_ – has been the site of major crises at catastrophic economic, social and human cost. The Co-operative Society on the high street. Image: Flickr/Kake Pugh One solution, of course, is cooperative finance. Globally, more than 50,000 credit unions already serve nearly 200 million members in 100 countries. Europe's cooperative banking sector comprises almost 4,000 co-op banks with 50 million members. But there is probably also the need for a strong public utility function in banking. Retaining community control over investment through public banks, or even community control over fixed capital in enterprises (in effect renting out the means of production to self-managing groups of workers), could help internalise externalities, the community being the ultimate universal owner. Public ownership more generally, should be reclaimed from its fate as a bailout mechanism for private capital. Andrew Cumbers, Professor of Geographical Political Economy at the University of Glasgow, argues convincingly for a democratised public ownership that is \"not only an increasingly urgent requirement but also a practical possibility in the years ahead\". His \"preliminary sketch\" of a system designed around public ownership extends the definition of \"public\" to encompass \"all those attempts, both outside and through the state, to create forms of collective ownership in opposition to...capitalist social relations\". Overall, he concludes, \"we should aspire towards examples of democratically controlled forms of public ownership that are technically necessary at higher levels while relinquishing control of other activities as far as possible to the local level\". Finally, after three decades of market expansionism and the impoverishment of the public domain, a strong dose of decommodification should be included in any model with regard to public space, the environment, health care, education and all the other crucial ingredients of a flourishing commons. \"Only this\", Robin Blackburn argues, \"can 'neutralise' the floating electric charge of capital by tying it to the 'earth' of mutual or public property, which can no longer be bought and sold\". Democratising Capital at Scale Part of the intuitive appeal of co-ops is their practicality and immediacy, such that it is easy to imagine an economy in which cooperative forms proliferate. But there are plenty of other real-world examples of democratic wealth-holding institutions and strategies that work in practice and can also be taken to scale. Take public banking: the US federal government currently operates around 140 different banks and quasi-banks, from the Import-Export Bank to agricultural lending programs. At the state level, the Bank of North Dakota has contributed more than $300 million to public revenues over ten years and has been highly successful in promoting community lending by local banks and developing the state economy. In Germany, in addition to more than a thousand cooperative banks there are over 400 Sparkassen, publicly owned savings banks that together have nearly 250,000 employees and 50 million customers. Unlike some of the larger banks (private and public), these two pillars of the German banking system have, according to the Economist, \"come through the crisis with barely a scratch\". Other opportunities for democratic control over investment abound. City and local government economic development programs increasingly lend to – or make direct investments in – local businesses. Economically targeted investments channel public pension assets into job creation and community economic development. Venture capital funds give public authorities an equity stake in local investments. Municipal enterprises build infrastructure and provide services, raising revenue and promoting employment and economic stability, diversifying the base of locally controlled capital. New experiments with participatory budgeting allow for direct citizen engagement in the allocation of public funds. 'Commons management systems' cover everything from the Internet to public libraries, parks and blood banks. Public trusts receive revenues from timber and mineral rights to grazing and oil production, in turn providing funding streams that (as with the Texas Permanent School Fund) underwrite public spending or (as with the Alaska Permanent Fund) issue a citizen dividend. Two additional intermediate strategies are suggestive of possibilities for a transition to economic democracy: mobilising 'labour's capital' in the form of workers' vast pension assets, and enacting a share levy on major corporations. 'Pension fund socialism' may not be emblazoned on many banners, but proposals going back to the seventies and eighties have called upon the trade union movement to 'harness pension power' by taking command of the huge pools of capital amassed by workers' retirement funds as a critical first step toward a democratic investment agenda based on the premise that workers generate capital and should also direct its uses. As Tony Benn has argued, pension funds \"belong to the workers, they are their own deferred earnings. Workers want them not only as income when they retire, but to sustain and create jobs while they are at work, and so to guarantee that they will retire in a buoyant economy\". Any such strategy by trade unions or public agencies should be focussed on \"the potential for using pension capital as an opening wedge in the development of basic economic alternatives\", shifting the power that flows from control of pension assets to advance \"a worker-owner view of value in the allocation of capital by firms and markets\". Lastly, there is the example of the Meidner Plan. Rudolf Meidner, chief economist at the _Landorganisationen_, the Swedish trade union federation, outlined his visionary proposal as a radical response to the strategic challenges facing the labour movement in the 1970s. He wrote: \"how to increase the level of savings but not inequality of wealth, and how to ensure that an increase in savings would translate into the kinds of investment that would sustain full employment, real-wage growth, and continued welfare-state expansion\". Against the backdrop of a solidaristic wage policy, and based on the moral claim that corporate profits derived in part from hidden public subsidy, the Meidner Plan required that corporations return a percentage of their profits to workers as equity. These shares would be entrusted to regional public bodies – 'wage-earner funds' – which would direct the eventual returns to meet agreed-upon social purposes. Companies with over 50 or 100 employees (depending on the version) would thus have been transferred to collective ownership as the funds increased their holdings through the receipt of new shares. Meidner estimated that it would have taken wage-earner funds 35 years to acquire 49 per cent of the equity of a corporation operating at an annual rate of profit of 10 per cent. But the real beauty of the scheme was that the higher the profits, the faster the socialisation: the mirror-opposite of the various instances of 'lemon socialism' which have seen public ownership

She still can't speak but she nods. She is cold. She looks down and her tears drops to her arms. She is topless aside from her bra, and she is trembling. \"Okay good then. Let's get this started!\" Captain claps his hands together and slaps Sarge on the back. Chapter Five: Class Begins The Washington Times: Berkeley protesters form human chain to stop white students from getting to class ***** Sarge pulls a satchel from the backpack and sets it down on the speaker's podium. Captain pulls the backpack inn front of the white board and Joanna watches him as he digs through it. Joanna can't stand it. She's sitting there, tied to chair in a lecture hall where she has given many great speeches and taught many great classes. She is too confused to think through this and can no longer stay calm. Panic sets in and she lets out a roar. \"Ahhh, let me out of here! What do you want? Let me go!\" She starts violently trying to throw her chair and rip her arms out of the tape, \"Please! Let me go! I haven't done anything!\" Sarge instantly grabs the chair and holds it firm to the floor and then without hesitation, raises his hand and slams it across her face. \"Now, why did you have to go and do that?\" he says, \"I thought professors like you were smart!\" he pauses, \"But then again, that's why were here, isn't it?\" \"That's right!\" Captain adds, \"It's no secret anymore Professor. We know your ignorance and stupidity is right up there with the best of them!\" Sarge lets go of her and steps back over to the podium. He pulls out a pen and a pad of paper, \"So, here's what we're going to do smart lady, it's time for you to have a lesson! We talk. You listen.\" He puts the pen in one of her hands and the pad of paper in the other, \"You might just want to take notes.\" He flashes her a sarcastic smile. Out of nowhere, there's a flash and it catches Joanna by surprise. \"Great shot! You look great,\" says Captain as he puts his camera back into the backpack. Joanna is stunned. She is lightheaded from her outburst and breaks down. She can't control her tears and her body is buzzing, and feels numb. Sarge has just pulled out some papers. She sucks up her breath in an attempt to calm down. The tears keep filling up her eyes but she tries to focus. \"Okay now, let's begin,\" he holds a picture of a baby wrapped in a blue blanket up to her face, and he asks her, \"what do you see here?\" Joanna is just staring at him, makeup washing down her face. \"Speak up when spoken to Professor!\" Captain yells at her. She can't stop sniffling but gets out an answer, \"Yes, Okay.\" \"All right then, let's try this again,\" Sarge holds up his picture one more time, \"what is this a picture of?\" \"It is a baby,\" she says. \"That's right,\" Sarge tells her. He hands the picture to Captain who slams it up onto the whiteboard and tapes it there. Sarge breaks out another picture and this time it's of a boy around six, \"Can you tell me what this is?\" He waits for a minute but she says nothing, \"Come on now, it's not that hard...give it to me in detail.\" \"It...it's a boy...at Christmas,\" She is so confused she is choking on her words, \"Please, just tell me, what is this? What does any of this have to do with me?\" \"Stop your whining bitch!\" Sarge yells, \"Man, is that a requirement at this school?\" he asks, looking to Captain as he hands him the picture. Captain tapes it up on the whiteboard next to the baby picture. \"Why do you do the things you do Professor?\" Sarge is violently waving his hands in the air as if questioning her sanity. \"I don't know!\" Joanna yells out, \"I mean, I don't know what you are talking about!\" \"Would you hurt a child?\" Sarge asks her. \"Of course...I, I would never ...\" Joanna lowers her head, tears still flowing. She drops her pen and immediately looks up to see if another punishment is coming for the error. \"You know,\" Captain breaks in, \"I don't think she's taking this class seriously. She's still in her head!\" \"I think you're right,\" says Sarge, setting his papers down on the podium. Captain walks up to Joanna and kneels down. He's looking her up and down. Her nylons are ripped from walking in the rain and her knee is bleeding a bit from scraping it on the sidewalk. He starts tapping his fingers on it. Joanna cringes under her skin with every tap. He reaches up to her hair and wipes her bangs from her face, \"Well, here's a problem Sarge, she can't see!\" he observes. Sarge walks over, \"Well isn't that a shame, let me get that for you.\" He rips a long piece of duct tape and tugs her hair back. He tapes her hair up and away from her face, wrapping it around from her forehead to the back of her neck. \"And what are these?\" Captain asks, inspecting her earrings, \"Are those diamonds?\" She just tilts her head away from him. She is wearing drop earrings with diamonds hanging down. He starts rubbing her ear lobes and inspecting them, \"Really nice! You get those with your high-end smart-teacher salary?\" She refuses to look at him. She is terrified and her body is jerking with fear as his fingers fun over her ears. He then grabs hold of each earring and without warning rips them both out of her ears at the same time. Joanna screams and starts jumping up and down in her chair. Captain is still looking at her, \"Hurts, doesn't it?\" He laughs a bit and runs his hand over her face and his fingertips over her chest. Blood is dripping down onto her shoulders. \"You've handed out enough pain Professor,\" Sarge points out, \"stop your crying!\" Captain throws the earrings to the side with everything else, \"You got that right!\" \"So,\" Sarge says, \"where were we? Oh yes. Now do we have your attention? Time to get serious.\" He smiles. Chapter Six: The Mid-term The Blaze: The students also said they would like university campuses to have safe spaces from student loans, penalties for underage drinking and penalties for large parties...***** Get serious? Joanna is starting to hyperventilate again, \"I'll do whatever you want! What is it that you want?\" Captain giver her back her pen, \"No worries Professor, this is just a discussion, not an exam,\" he winks at Joanna, \"I know you know what I mean.\" She is sweating. Her arms hurt from the tape and her head hurts from the madness. She can feel the warm blood dripping down her shoulders and the pain in her ears is piercing. But then she has a thought. What did he just say? Is her referring to...no, he can't possibly be! She just wrote her letter to her students, like she has done many times. His words are eerily familiar and it's making her nauseous. It takes a minute, but she comes out of her daze and sees that Sarge is holding yet another picture. This time, it is of a boy in his teens and he is holding up an award that says, NEC Second Place Medal. \"Now I know you know what this is!\" \"N...national econ, economic award,\" she spits out. She tries to look away but Sarge is holding the picture in front of her no matter what she does. \"That's right it is,\" Sarge calmly gives the picture to Captain and like the others, it goes onto the whiteboard. Then he just stands in front of Joanna and sighs, \"What are we going to do with you?\" \"Wh-What?\" she asks. She refuses to look at him. \"You just don't want to be here, do you?\" He watches her shake her head no and then slaps her across the face one more time. He then gets a piece of rope out of his bag. Captain holds her head up and back against the chair and Sarge takes the rope and ties it through the holds in the back of the chair and around her neck, talking to her as he goes, \"What I can't figure out is...HOW does someone like you get to be...someone like you?\" He pulls on the rope. Any tighter and he'd be strangling her. She is gasping for air. \"You have all your awards and recognitions, you have your big office and position at a great school!\" He secures the rope behind the chair, it's snug but she has enough room to breath, and then takes a step back, \"I guess you just got stupid! Just like you're making all the kids stupid!\" Joanna can't help but face the front now. Her eyes are glued to Sarge. He breaks out more pictures. Chapter Seven: The Final The Brown Daily Herald: Schoolwork, advocacy place strain on student activists - Students struggle with mental health, academic pressures as they act on social justice responsibilities. *****\" It's time for the big stuff now Professor. You should get it no problem,\" he holds up another picture. Joanna recognizes the boy in it immediately. It's Jeremy Collins, one of her students. Well, former student, as he left the school earlier that year. He was a Junior. Joanna is taken aback. She can't take her eyes of the picture. She then scans the pictures on the white board and is suddenly even more terrified than before realizing they are all of Jeremy. This cannot be good!

Though some might feel they are destined to fail, this is not true. Men and women of all ages can achieve success. But they must understand and practice the right formula—and only after they understand exactly what they are trying to achieve! ##Hypothesis on the Subject of Success Many believe that success involves achieving a certain amount of WEALTH. Their only purpose for being is to accumulate money and material goods. As one man said, \"The goal is to see who can die with the most toys.\" They seem to believe that only by having a significant \"net worth\" (and many possessions) can they say that they have \"arrived.\" Yet these same people never find true happiness at the end of the \"money rainbow.\" Others come to believe that success is a reflection of how much POWER they have. It is as though the measure of their life is counted by their influence over people, events or even economic, governmental or world affairs. Such people usually have \"controlling\" personalities. To them, success is how much—or how many—they control. Generally speaking, these people are more miserable than those who seek wealth. And they often make others around them even more miserable than themselves. They usually live in fear of losing their power. Still others hope to achieve FAME. These people are often driven by a need to be known. The more who are aware of their name, the better? They seek to possess \"name recognition.\" Of course, everyone would love to enjoy at least their \"15 minutes of fame.\" But not everyone believes that fame equals success. And those who are famous represent probably the most miserable \"success\" category. In every case, the people who appear to have achieved success have gained a certain level of status. Whether that success involves wealth, power and influence, or fame, a certain status in comparison to others has been reached. In other words, success involved elevating oneself above others. Very few are ever considered to be a success without having obtained one or more of these commonly described elements of status. Think for a moment! And be honest. How many people can you think of who you consider truly successful, but who do not fit into one of these categories? I doubt you can think of many, if any. ###Flourishing People? What about people generally thought to have achieved success in their fields? Let's briefly consider some examples. Some time ago, a great baseball player died. Whenever famous athletes die, sports writers delve into their accomplishments by examining their statistics in comparison to other \"greats\" in the same sport. Most sports writers and fellow baseball players considered this \"hall of famer\" to be the greatest hitter of all time. At age 19, he had openly declared, \"I want to be the greatest hitter who ever played the game.\" He achieved his goal. Yet he was married three times and generally considered to be a very unhappy person. He maintained a love-hate relationship with fans in his team's city for over twenty years. He despised the press until the day that he died because of a single item they wrote about him at the beginning of his career. His children went on to fight over his remains—with one son seeking to freeze and clone him into more identical great hitters. Before his own untimely death, this son hoped to \"bring him back to life. \"Is this success? Did this man's life reflect success? Many great athletes achieved the records and resulting recognition that they did because they set out to accomplish them. But usually by their thirties, they could no longer compete and perform at the world-class level that they once did. Eventually, their records were always broken by someone who was a little bigger, better, faster or stronger. Before long, most of their feats on the field of competition were forgotten. Did recognition by their peers, fans and sports writers of their era mean that they were a success? What about movie stars or popular musicians? Some achieve a level of worldwide fame practically unparalleled in any other endeavour. They are virtually viewed as gods and goddesses. They are pampered, continually written about and photographed, and often become extremely wealthy, having as many as five or six homes in various parts of the world. Yet, when many cannot find happiness within several marriages, they turn to alcohol, drugs, sex and, in many cases, suicide. ###Do These People's Lives Reflect True Success? Consider the great captains of industry. Many command enormous salaries and wealth, and wield great power within multi-billion dollar corporations. They live their lives as the \"rich and famous.\" And yet, an almost endless string of unfolding daily scandals reveals that many of these \"captains\" wanted even more money and more power—and were willing to break laws and practice corruption in order to accumulate what they sought. In the end, they had no principles—and seemingly little or no character. ###Were These Really A Success? And what of the more respectable great business tycoons of just 100 years ago? After being gone so long, who remembers what they accomplished—assuming anyone even remembers their names? How many people today concern themselves with the net worth of J.P. Morgan? And how many even know who he was? How many remember Carnegie, Mellon, Dantata and many more. Were such men truly successful? What did their wealth and fame gain them? If they couldn't \"take it with them,\" and they have been largely or entirely forgotten, what good did it do them—what permanent success did it bring? Whatever \"success\" they achieved was temporary—at best a fleeting illusion. I read recently of one multi-millionaire who proclaimed, \"Ever since I was three years old, the only thing I wanted was to make money. I wanted to own more university properties than anyone in the world.\" This man went on to receive a long prison sentence for drug-related charges and the government seized everything that he had. Ultimately, where did his goals take him? What did they achieve for him? Many years ago, another man said: my father sold one of his businesses to a man who had been one of my childhood friends. He told my father, \"My goal is to be a million dollars in debt.\" He explained that his reasoning was \"if I am that far in debt, it means that I have so many irons in the fire that something has to pop.\" Because the nature of my father's business had peaked, he sold it at the right time. My father enjoyed reminding me that he had certainly \"helped your (my) friend toward his goal. \"This is an unusual example. But it shows how some people's values and goals can become terribly mixed up. Ask another question: Did famous authors or inventors truly achieve success, simply because their works outlived them? If you answer yes, are you sure? On what basis were they a success? Are you absolutely certain your definition of success is the correct one? If most people's view of success is correct, then why is there so much misery in the lives of people who have achieved human wealth, power and fame? Why do they often change mates like they were changing shoes? Why are so many of these \"success stories\" quietly delving into drugs, alcohol, overwork, free sex, materialism, escapism and pleasure-seeking? Why are their lives empty—devoid of meaning? Why are their children often shameful examples that evidence miserable home lives? Why, when asked, do so many say that wealth, power and fame was not satisfying? Why are so many unable to handle \"accomplishment\"? ##You Are Not Wired To Fail! Thinking of the world at large, so many elderly people especially in the recent time depend on government programs and various kinds of aid to survive. Vast numbers are dependent when they should be independent. As they reach old age, they feel uncertain and worried, because they never plotted the course of their life toward a clear and definite end. They had never set out to achieve true success. Here is why this happens to so many! The general assumption is that success is largely a by-product of one's natural ability. It is as though \"you have it or you don't.\" Most think they have little control over their own success or failure. They have been programmed by common assumptions to believe that they cannot do much to change their level of achievement in life. Is this true? Is success or failure entirely connected to talents one is born with? I learned that people's success was far more connected to the desire to produce, learn, grow and achieve than to any other reason. Yet, I found that virtually all those who did not succeed, could have—if they had known and applied the LAWS to success. I came to realize that people fail by choice, not by inherited traits—their \"genetics.\" I learned that people have far more control over the direction of their lives than they realize, or are willing to admit. So, most languish throughout their lives believing there is little or nothing they can do to achieve the success they long for. ###\"Short Cut Riches\" Syndrome Once again, most do not understand that there are absolute, definite rules that must be applied on the path to a specific, carefully established goal. Neither do most even try to figure out the one great goal toward which they should point their lives to achieve. Yet these same people would be only too eager to be handed great sums of money, if it involved expending only minimal effort. Let me prove this! How many people buy lottery tickets? It must be many millions. For just the effort of purchasing a fifty-cent or one-dollar ticket, these many millions hope to \"hit it big.\" They want something for nothing. How many of these same people, or others like them, enter every conceivable kind of sweepstakes in hopes of \"winning big\"? Television ads continually depict the winners being surprised at their front door. Then there are game shows. Invariably, these programs all come back to the hope of someone taking home winnings for simply giving better answers in a half-hour contest.

Type 2: HDPE High-Density Polyethylene - Generally safe Milk containers, detergent bottles, freezer bags and plastic grocery bags often contain high-density polyethylene, a relatively stiff plastic. Type 2 plastic neither contains Bisphenols A nor Phthalates. It is not known to contain other harmful chemicals. High-density polyethylene containers may have the symbol \"HDPE\" on them. Type 3: V Polyvinyl Chloride – General not safe, contains Phthalates Polyvinyl chloride contains Phthalates that can cause reproductive problems in animals and humans. Type 3 plastic can be plasticized or unplasticized; the former is clear and flexible, the latter is more rigid. Food containers commonly made with polyvinyl chloride include fruit juice bottles, cooking oil bottles and clear food packaging. Plasticized PVC pipes and siding contain Phthalates as well. Polyvinyl chloride containers may have the symbol \"V\" on them. There are claims that PVC poses serious environmental health threats. According to the Center for Health, Environment, and Justice, the production of PVC requires chemicals like the \"highly polluting chlorine,\" the \"cancer-causing\" vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), and ethylene dichloride (EDC). They also claim that PVC plastic requires large amounts of toxic additives to make it stable and usable. These additives are released during use and disposal, resulting in \"elevated human exposures to Phthalates, lead, cadmium, tin, and other toxic chemicals.\" In 2000, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed national standards to limit air toxic emissions from polyvinyl chloride production plants. Type 4: LDPE Low-Density Polyethylene - Generally safe Frozen foods packaging and condiment squeeze bottles often contain Type 4 plastic because it is flexible and resistant to solvents. Type 4 plastic does not contain any known harmful chemicals. Low-density polyethylene containers may have the symbol \"LDPE\" on them. Do not reuse, do not microwave. Type 5: PP Polypropylene – Generally safe Polypropylene containers do not leach harmful chemicals into foods or liquids. They commonly contain yogurt, medicine, drinks, ketchup and medicines. Type 5 plastic is flexible, hard and semi-transparent and has high resistance to solvents. Polypropylene containers may have the symbol \"PP\" on them. Do not reuse, do not microwave. Type 6: PS Polystyrene - Generally safe Type 6 plastic is clear, rigid and glassy. It does not resist fats or solvents well. However, it does not contain BPA, Phthalates. There is one major problem with Polystyrene, when it is exposed it any kind of heat, or sunlight, it will leach Styrene into the food or drink that it contains. You can find polystyrene in most to-go food containers, dairy containers, vending cups, meat trays, and over-the-counter medical bottles. A well-known polystyrene brand is Styrofoam. Polystyrene containers may have the symbol \"PS\" on them. Do not reuse, do not microwave. Type 7: OTHER Polycarbonate and others - General not safe You should avoid type 7 plastic containers because they contain BPA that leaches into their contents. Type 7 plastics often have the symbol \"PC\" or \"Other\" on them. You will find polycarbonate plastics in 3- and 5-gallon water-cooler bottles; hard, plastic reusable water bottles; and to-go coffee mugs. Manufacturers use polycarbonate for these purposes because it is virtually shatter-proof. Required to Recycle: Mandatory Recycling Some cities and states, such as Seattle, have created mandatory recycling laws for both commercial entities, as well as citizens by charging fines to those who throw away recyclable materials. Minnesota is also implementing recycling laws that are getting stricter for commercial entities such as businesses and sporting facilities. CalRecycle is working to encourage increased recycling in California's commercial sector by creating a mandatory commercial recycling law. In countries outside of the U.S., mandatory recycling has become the standard by which people live their lives. In all the 28 countries of the European Union, all paper, plastic, metals, and glass are prohibited from being placed in garbage. There is stick enforcement of the required recycle laws, and overall recycle rates for municipal trash have risen to almost 40 percent. Currently, Austria boasts a rate of 63 percent while the U.S. reports a 34 percent recycle rate. This means that we threw away, into landfills, over 161 million tons of recyclables. The U.S. recycling industry is thought to employ over a million workers and generates over $236 billion in annual revenue. We could do more. Back to the Bottle Deposit A number of U.S. states, including California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Oregon, and Vermont have passed laws that establish deposits or refund values by encouraging reusing and recycling of beverage containers. This is known as a Bottle bill or container deposit law. Most states refund five cents per can or bottle, but some can refund up to 10 cents. When it comes to laws and regulations governing many different types of recycling, the United States is a patchwork of ordinances with varying degrees of requirements and toughness. As there is no federal law that mandates recycling of materials. While some state, county and city governments choose not to regulate recycling, there are lots of legislatures that do just the opposite. Here are a few of U.S. cities and states that have enacted the most stringent recycling regulations in the nation: San Francisco, CA – With some of the leading environmental laws in the nation, it likely comes as little surprise that San Francisco is a leader when it comes to recycling too. In fact, the city's current zero waste recycling law, which was enacted in 2009, is often referred to as the strictest recycling law in the nation. After the city met the state-mandated landfill diversion of 50 percent by 2000, city officials decided to aim higher and set a goal of 75 percent diversion by 2010 and, even more impressively, zero waste by 2020. The city now diverts 80 percent of waste from landfills. The program relies heavily on simple sorting into color coded containers, educational outreach to citizens, wide acceptance of a variety of materials – including food scraps – and enforcement of the policies in place. Fines are even an option for offenders who don't change their recycling behavior after warnings from the city. Seattle, WA – Not to be outdone by their California counterparts, the City of Seattle maintains their own strict set of recycling regulations for residents and businesses. Since 2005, residential customers have been required to recycle plastic, glass, aluminum and tin, resulting in 71 percent of total residential waste being recycled. For Seattle businesses, it is mandatory to recycle cardboard and paper, but that list of required recyclables could soon grow longer. A Seattle councilwoman recently introduced legislation that would require businesses to recycle the same materials that residents do. If passed, the law would take effect in July 2014, and it's estimated that it could prevent 6,000 tons of recyclables per year from ending up in landfills. Pittsburgh, PA – Although Pittsburgh might not be the first place you would think of as eco-friendly, the city has recently undergone a green renaissance. That's why it's not surprising that the city has recycling laws that are as tough as its nickname of The Steel City. Every Pittsburgh resident, institution and business is required to participate in curbside recycling programs. Like San Francisco, the City of Pittsburgh will even fine recycling law offenders after multiple infractions. The state recently toughened these laws by refusing to accept electronic equipment for curbside waste pick up, so Pittsburgh residential and commercial customers must now also participate in electronic recycling. #Chapter Eight BPA Free: The Regrettable Substitution While the U.S. has done very little, BPA has been banned by Canadian Government, and many other European countries due to the world-wide health concerns. With BPA being run out of town, there is a whole class of chemicals are related to BPA and just as dangerous to humans. This chemical family is called simply \"the Bisphenols\". They are identified pseudo-alphabetically, spanning letters A-Z: Bisphenol-A, Bisphenol AB, Bisphenol AF, Bisphenol B, Bisphenol BP, Bisphenol C, Bisphenol E, Bisphenol F, Bisphenol G, Bisphenol M, Bisphenol S, Bisphenol P, Bisphenol PH, Bisphenol TMC, Bisphenol Z. Despite the many plastics industry public affairs spokespersons and chemical industry-funded scientists claiming that BPA does not possess estrogenic properties of any biological significance that is simply not true. Long, long ago, BPA was first recognized and frequently used as an artificial estrogen in the early 1930's, where it was used both to fatten poultry and cattle, as well as a form of human estrogen replacement therapy in women in the mid-1930's. Only later, in the 1940's, did Bayer and General Electric research and develop BPA to harden polycarbonate plastics and make epoxy resin. Today BPA is the industry standard for plastic resin and used to line nearly the entire world's supply of food and beverage containers. **Meet the Bisphenols**, Here is their family picture. They are a pernicious clan of chemicals that are capable of inflecting great harm to both humanity and the environment. When they arrive into the kitchen, and make contact with our food, they become insidious killers. The Bisphenols are a pervasive alien family of Endocrine Disruptors. Be on the lookout for them. BPA analogs: A dangerous shell game In the United States and abroad, in response to laws banning BPA, and growing consumer concerns over the safety of BPA, manufacturers have been rapidly substituting Bisphenol S (and possibly other Bisphenol analogues) in its place. Despite the industry-wide move away from BPA towards BPS, they both exhibit similar harmful estrogen-like properties. The National Food Institute, Technical University of Denmark, has investigated whether five compounds resembling Bisphenol-A can be used as alternatives. Denmark's National Food Institute (NFI) has said it considers it 'unwise' to replace...The NFI Technical University of Denmark looked at five possible alternatives...It turns out that the compounds tested have the potential to have the same harmful effects as Bisphenol-A, and the National Food Institute cautions against using them. All test compounds caused the same qualitative effects on estrogen receptor and androgen receptor activities, and most of the alternatives exhibited potencies within the same range as BPA In a 2012, a New York State Department of Health study was conducted by the Wadsworth Center and published in the May 25, 2012 edition of Environmental Science & Technology. The New York State researchers gathered samples of thermal paper receipts, paper currencies, flyers, magazines, and newspapers from around the country and found high levels of BPS.

Sometimes it's hard being a robot. Should 'artifacts' be treated ethically? In other words, if an action would be considered abusive towards a human being, is the same behaviour abusive if it is done to a robot? \"This is a call for informed debate on the ethical issues raised by the forthcoming widespread use of robots, particularly in domestic settings. Research shows that humans can sometimes become very abusive towards computers and robots particularly when they are seen as human-like and this raises important ethical issues.\" Uh, huh. \"The designers of robotic systems need to take an ethical stance on at least three specific questions. Firstly is it acceptable to treat artifacts – particularly human-like artifacts – in ways that we would consider it morally unacceptable to treat humans? Second, if so, just how much sexual or violent 'abuse' of an artificial agent should we allow before we censure the behaviour of the abuser? Thirdly is it ethical for designers to attempt to 'design out' abusive behaviour by users?\" \"Conclusions on these and related issues should be used to modify professional codes as a matter of urgency.\" – Oxford Journals. If I get pissed off and kick a dent in my car door, that might be stupid and ultimately, self-harming in that it detracts from the resale value. It might be wrong in that sense, but it's my machine, bought and paid for. I would think the same holds true for a robot, even if it portrays a woman or even if it's done in public. In the story, 'My New Girl,' I speculate about such an individual. His new girlfriend is expected to take a certain amount of abuse, and that would be far preferable to treating a real girlfriend the same way. I still think a lot of observers would draw moral conclusions about the subject's personality upon seeing such behaviour or attitudes. This is just one more example of the kind of cultural schizophrenia that already revolves around sexual mores in this society. Let's extrapolate to another culture, one where real human women are expected to be submissive to men. Pick any culture you want. The reader decides. How would that culture perceive the role of the sexual robot? Because in that sense, there are no inalterable moral values. They vary by culture, by creed, by upbringing, custom and tradition, and they vary for their time and place. Note: the author attempted to find the Roman Catholic Church's ruling, or any other considered moral opinion, on sex with a robot. The information is conspicuous by its absence, but one might assume the Church's ruling on onanism would cover it, and by extension, sex with a robot, as the author has already acknowledged, is a kind of masturbation in view of the lack of true humanity on the part of aforesaid robot. Other than that, no one really knows anything as far as I can see. Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide. Would you help someone to die if they asked you? Would you help your child to die if they were terminally ill and their lives were nothing but an unremitting hell of unbearable suffering? Do we have the right to die on demand? If we ourselves asked for an assisted suicide, should our wish be granted? After much controversy, Belgium has approved euthanasia of children. \"\" Why wouldn't you give children, who are incurably sick and who are unbearably suffering the same possibilities adults have?\" asked Dr. Jan Bernheim from the research team for terminal care at the Free University Brussels, speaking to DW before the law was approved.\" \"In Belgium euthanasia implemented by doctors has been legal for 11 years. Almost 1,432 elected to be euthanized in 2012 alone.\" \"The debate over euthanasia has heated up over the last few months after several spectacular cases emerged. In the October version of the Belgian magazine 'Panorama,' TV journalist Dirk Leestmans reported on a detainee who was granted the right to be euthanized. \"The inmate said the detention and the conditions in jail had caused him extreme psychological suffering and he therefore wanted to die. The case is still being reviewed by the courts. The inmate hasn't been euthanized yet, but his request seems poised for approval.\" \"This is not the only case that created an international sensation. At the beginning of October, a 44-year old, going by the name of Nathan, was euthanized after a failed sex change operation. He said his wish to die was legitimate because of unbearable psychological suffering.\" \"Carine Brochier of the European Institute of Bioethics in Brussels says, 'Family members, hospital staff and doctors are extremely burdened by the euthanasia law.\"' \"Euthanasia is not easy. It's not fun to kill someone. Euthanasia is really killing and that's not good for the person doing it, even if it is to kill suffering. It's also killing society,\" Brochier said. Euthanasia has been around for a long time. It's nothing new. It goes back to the Stone Age. France is slowly moving towards assisted suicide. \"On the strength of the panel's recommendations, left-wing daily Libération expects the socialist government to present a draft text by next summer, although widespread grassroots opposition earlier this year to the legalization of same-sex \"marriage\" might make president François Hollande wary of bringing yet another sensitive issue to the fore. \"It is the President himself, however, who decided last September to have the National Advisory Ethics Committee (CCNE) assemble a representative panel of French citizens chosen by a commercial polling company, IFOP, so that it could express ordinary people's opinions on end of life. The 18 'sages' gathered for four consecutive weekends in order to hear officially mandated experts, many of them favorable to at least one form of voluntary ending of life, including Jean-Luc Romero, president of the Association for the right to die with dignity (ADMD).\" From the same story comes the following. \"'The possibility of committing suicide with medical assistance, as well as assisted suicide, constitute in our view a legitimate right of the patient who is in the end phase of his life or who is under the burden of an irreversible pathology, a right which rests mainly on his informed consent and full consciousness,' they write.\" \"In practice, this would mean non-terminally but incurably ill patients – such as tetraplegics – should be eligible for this type of assistance, which is in fact akin to homicide.\" (Life Site News.) (Tetriplegic is another term for quadriplegic. – ed.) The wording is significant, as it entails the right, \"...to obtain medical help in order to finish life with dignity.\" The B.C. Supreme Court upheld the province's ban on assisted suicide, which will now be appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. It's important to see the distinctions. Euthanasia is present in all societies. It is simply not much talked about. It's not exactly the same as assisted suicide. A friend's dad was on a respirator after a major heart attack. A Canadian doctor spoke with the family after two weeks and told them there wasn't much hope for recovery. Under Canadian law, patients or anyone who makes a will can specify that 'no extraordinary means' will be used to keep them alive in the event of a major medical event. My friend's sister and mother could not bring themselves to do it. That left it up to my friend, and there's no doubt it affected him deeply. He and the doctor put their hands on the switch at the same time. They turned the respirator off. His father died of complications resulting from a heart attack. They have to put something as the cause of death on the official death certificate. He was eighty-seven years old. My own father suffered from Parkinson's Disease and after ten years, his condition was deteriorating on a daily and weekly basis. He was having a lot of falls, and a lot of choking incidents, and his quality of life was not very good. And yet he was prepared to continue living, which is only normal—he would have very much liked it if medical science had found a cure for Parkinson's Disease. Whenever something happened, he would be bedridden for some time, and then he seemed to be recovering, but never to the level he had enjoyed before. That is a feature of Parkinson's. I got the call about six a.m. one morning. He'd had some kind of problem, and he was in the hospital. His lungs were full of blood, and he was unconscious, and yet with his eyes open, wide and staring at the ceiling. With my siblings all there, the doctor asked us what we wanted to do. The sound of his breathing was horrifying. That great body wanted to live, but Parkinson's had killed him, or was killing him. Finally. \"We can operate, but there's no telling if we can really do anything for him...or what would be left if he did regain consciousness.\" The doctor's voice was calm and sympathetic, but he'd clearly seen all of this before. \"I can give him something to make him more comfortable—\" We decided that that was the thing to do—to give him something to make him more comfortable, and my siblings left the room while I took a turn, holding onto my father's hand, and the nurse stuck a big ampoule of something into his arm. It's hard. There's nothing harder than easing your loved one into the afterlife or the next world, which I don't really believe in. I thought his breathing would just stop, and he kept going. My siblings really weren't prepared to deal with this, and in some sense as the eldest I took a lot of responsibility for my father that day. I was glad they were out of the room and didn't have to see this. My sister just couldn't handle it and my younger brother wasn't much better. It was a way of acknowledging him, for all the responsibility that he took for his own children over the years. It was the right thing to do for a first-born son. He had expressed his wishes clearly for us, and had signed the declaration while still of sound mind, although his body was ravaged by the disease. My father's suffering was finally over, and there was really nothing there to bring back in any case. It would have done nothing more than to extend his suffering. It's not that I haven't thought about it since. What if we had gone ahead with an operation?

A black silhouette flashed at her contact, the humanoid figure blurred into electric purple motion, and disappeared. \"They seem to have a similar apprehension to our form of life.\" \"You read its mind?\" Jillian asked, all too familiar with the carnivorous plant's telepathic touch. Leroy groaned, he sprawled on the ground, limbs still by his sides. Jillian knelt and helped the man to a seated position. \"I think that thing just ran right through me.\" \"Did that scanner take any readings?\" Jillian leaned over her partner, and put a hand over Leroy's examining the display. \"What does this indicate?\" She asked; her face only inches from Leroy's. \"I...uhh ...\" he stammered, lost in her eyes. The cool silver hand of the macrobot closed around the device and pulled it closed to the visages of Ren and Ileeta. \"Incredible!\" They exclaimed in unison. \"You've seen that before?\" Jillian asked. \"Dark matter and dark energy were only theoretical concepts for our people. I never thought to see evidence of their existence,\" Ren said. \"The small amount of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen the scanner detected must be the part of that being we are able to observe,\" Ileeta said. Bloom had maneuvered around Leroy, Jillian, and the macrobot during their discussion. Its viney arms wrapped around what looked like dense shadow, its leaves rolled into straws. The others could feel her telepathic message of comfort and assurance directed at the figure in its embrace. \"This one is a scared youth.\" Suddenly, Jillian and the macrobot crashed to the ground, massive black figures loomed over them. Leroy jumped to their defense, tackling the larger figure around the waist. His momentum pulling the shadow back a few paces before Leroy landed in a tumble, having passed through the creature. Purple bolts leaped from both looming silhouettes and Leroy writhed in pain as they connected. The small shadow leapt from Bloom's embrace, encircling the larger pair. The assault ceased, Leroy moaned and slumped onto the ground. Bloom, Jillian, and the macrobot surrounded their colleague. In the confusion, the shadowy child and its parents disappeared into the surrounding brush. Leroy roused; his head cradled in Jillian's arms. \"I guess I'm the first person to see a ghost on two worlds,\" he smirked, and then he noticed Jillian and color flushed his complexion. #Like a Sponge Leroy and Jillian collected extra water canteens, stuffing their packs to the limit. The humans seemed intimidated by the dry, desolate world they landed upon. As a form of sentient carnivorous plant life, Bloom found that exploration of other worlds with sentient animal life evoked all sorts of curious behavior. The pair showed affection for one another, at times risking their own safety for the other's, yet would never admit their desire to be mating partners. Bloom and her mate never encountered this strange sort of denial during their courtship. \"Let's be sure you stay hydrated too Bloom\" Jillian tucked a slow release water spike into the loose soil in the center of Bloom's encased root cluster. Bloom patted her companion on the back with a prehensile vine arm. \"I sense that the local life forms have detected our arrival and approach the shuttle.\" Lacking the sensory organs humans are equipped with, Bloom used telepathy to interact with others. Bloom probed the alien minds until she grasped their form of communication, then the trio met with their hosts. ****** The Aridites thrived as a society of moisture collectors who inhabited a vast network of caves beneath the planet's barren surface. Leroy offered drawings of simple moisture collection devices to the desert bound species as an offer of friendship between the LARC5 colony and the Aridites. Just as the man began to think this the smoothest introduction he and Jillian had been involved in to date, cries of alarm ran through the cave mouth where they stood. ****** An Aridite youth waved frail limbs at its elders who barked a short response to Bloom before all the Aridites present disappeared into the dark depths beneath their meeting place. \"Someone in this tribe of Aridites has committed their ultimate crime, water theft.\" Bloom reached out through her senses during the silent moments while the trio awaited their host's return. \"An Aridite is coming, but I don't think it's one we've been speaking to.\" Jillian moved forward into the darkness and whispered to the others \"If this is the thief, you two distract it and I'll grab from behind.\" ******\" Hello there little buddy,\" Leroy called to the Aridite who hesitantly approached, knowing he wouldn't be understood, but hoping to arouse its curiosity. A swollen figure emerged from the dark and lumbered toward Leroy and Bloom, it barked a nervous response as it approached. \"The Aridite claims that there has been a misunderstanding,\" Bloom said as she spread her arm vines in a welcoming gesture. \"Put it there pal\" Leroy said, approaching the water thief with his hand outstretched. Jillian used Leroy's distraction to tackle the Aridite around its middle, the pair rolled across the cave floor in a cloud of dust. Apprehension showed clear on Leroy's expression as he waited for the dust to settle. Jillian uttered a low painful moan. A sloshing sound began in the dust and faded into the dark depths of the cave. \"Jillian, are you alright?\" Leroy groped about the dusty scene until he found the woman and pulled her to the shuttle's open hatch. \"Bloom, she has somehow suffered severe dehydration. I've got to hook her up to an IV solution right away.\" ******\" I'm going after it,\" Bloom replied. She did not wait to see Leroy's distracted nod. Now that the telepath had touched the mind of Jillian's assailant, tracking the Aridite proved a simple matter. Four vine limbs propelled Bloom with inhuman speed. She had wrapped the culprit in her grasp in minutes. The Aridite barked a harsh warning and struggled to free itself. Bloom began to feel her vines wither from dehydration, the water spike near her roots quickly drained and weakness washed over her entire body. In a final desperate effort, Bloom dislodged a root cluster and jammed it down the Aridite's throat. Its eyes bulged and it spluttered, attempting to speak through the root mass. The water bloated figure collapsed in a heap and Bloom felt the moisture return as her captive drained off excess moisture. Bloom emerged from the darkness to find the Aridites offering vessels of drinking water to Leroy. She deposited the thief at the feet of its peers. \"Bloom, great job!\" Leroy rustled her upper vines in what he meant to be a pat on the back. \"Please tell these guys Jillian will be fine and we've already begun replacing her moisture. Oh, and tell that guy,\" he pointed to the culprit \"To keep his sponge off my partner!\" #Lithium Eaters\" If not for the telescope operator's infrared scan, the starship might have plunged right into this little star,\" Jillian peered out a view port into a vast, round, sea of hydrogen, larger than any planet would be. \"I'll bet we could swim in it\" Leroy said, as he ambled over to share the view. \"What are we supposed to look for here anyhow?\" Jillian gasped and pressed her face against the glass. \"Did you see that?\" ****** Leroy could see only blonde locks now and took a moment to enjoy their scent before telling Jillian of the obstruction. \"There,\" she pointed, after withdrawing a few feet. \"There are things swimming in the star. It looks like they are grazing on the dark clumps of lithium that bubble to the surface.\" As the pair of explorers' shuttle hovered over the surface of a Y class brown dwarf, nearly invisible to the naked eye due to a temperature close to that of a human body, creatures not unlike jellyfish used bioluminescence to find and consume lithium, the hydrogen star's lone byproduct. \"Let's make contact. This could be the first time anyone discovered life on a star!\" Leroy rushed for the control console. ****** Jillian put a hand on her partner's shoulder. Had he been working out? She would have to put even more than the usual effort into keeping their interactions strictly professional. She leaned over his shoulder, excited by the cluster of activity on the display, and inadvertently brushed cheeks with him while pressing her chest against his back. \"Bring us in right here.\" ****** Leroy couldn't tell if the thrill of the hunt or Jillian's proximity made his heart pound. He gasped a quick inhalation as he directed the craft. The vessel hovered within a dozen feet of the pulsating, billowing, creatures. Jillian sat next to Leroy and her fingers flashed on the control panel. Leroy cocked an eyebrow. \"What are you working on over there?\" \"Their bioluminescence, maybe flashing simple patterns with the shuttle's exterior lights will enable us to communicate.\" Leroy gazed out the front viewport as his partner began the attempt. Light and dark alternated for a dozen flashes. The shoal of lithium eaters froze momentarily, then repeated the sequence with their own lights. Leroy gasped and Jillian giggled with delight. The shoal closed in and spread out, surrounding the shuttle, as if investigating the strange visitor. After a moment, the pair felt their shuttle lurch, and begin to descend into the sea of hydrogen. \"They are pulling us down!\" Leroy said, hands returned to the console. \"I'll try the lights again.\" After another sequence of flashes, the shuttle lurched deeper into the star. \"I'm going to try to pull free.\" Leroy maneuvered the craft on low propulsion toward the surface. Then another shoal emerged from the star's depths and joined onto the hull. The shuttle creaked and groaned under the opposing strain. A warning light flashed on the console. \"We've had a minor structural failure and plasma is leaking from the aft engine,\" Jillian reported. \"I'll dispatch the repair drone immediately.\" \"Look!\" Leroy pointed to a rear display. \"Most of them are after the plasma, now is our best chance!\" Leroy floored the throttle and the shuttle burst free from beneath the hydrogen sea. As they departed into open space, the straggling lithium eaters detached and returned home. \"Looks"], "id": "id327"}, "stats_key": {"light_scenario_key": {"scenario_spec": {"class_name":

Sacks that peasants hid underground were found and dragged out of their holes by Communist militants. Villagers who had hidden the sacks were tortured to death. In the Kurgan region in 1918, bags of wheat were forcibly collected from the people to feed the Red Army. s.50 A photograph of Lenin, shortly before his death. s.51 LENIN'S END IS A LESSON FOR ALL Before he died, Lenin became mad. This photograph, taken shortly before his death, teaches an example of the torment God sends in this world upon leaders of irreligion. This end is announced in Verse 30:10 of the Qur'an: \"Then the final fate of those who did evil will be the worst because they denied God's signs and mocked at them.\" s.52 Lenin's body was mummified like an Egyptian pharaoh's and placed in a tomb reminiscent of a Greek temple. s.54 Stalin was brought up to be a priest, but at a young age was drawn into atheism by some books he read, the most influential of which was Darwin's Origin of Species. After Stalin had joined the ranks of the Communists, he was arrested several times under the Tsar's regime. At left, a series of photographs of one of those arrests. s.55 Stalin became close to Lenin in his latter days and tried to advance within the party. Upon Lenin's death, Stalin overcame his rivals and became the Soviet Union's sole ruler. s.57 Peasants in Ukraine in 1929 listening to collectivization propaganda. Collectivization was presented as a way to increase agricultural yield, but its implementation caused a terrible famine. s.61 This little Russian child is skin and bones as a result of hunger caused by Stalin's policy of deliberate famine. s.62 While Russians were dying of hunger, the Communist Party's barns were crammed full. Below, a church used as a storehouse for grain during the implementation of collectivization in the 1930s. s.63 Above, a mother and child starving to death. Below, small children who died from the famine. As a result of Stalin's deliberate famine, four million Ukrainians died. s.64-65 STALIN'S LIE...... AND STALIN'S TRUTH s.65 One characteristic of Communism is its reliance on officially produced and disseminated lies. As a result of the famine Stalin fabricated in the Soviet Union, six million died of hunger, and tens of thousands of children were targets of this disaster. This photograph documents the \"standard of living\" deemed acceptable for Russian children in Stalin's era. But propaganda posters depicted Stalin as a kind, concerned leader receiving gifts of flowers from happy children. s.68 A gulag prison in the Magadan region of Siberia. Here, millions lived and died under appalling conditions. s.69 STALIN'S DEATH CAMPS These photos show some scenes of Stalin's death camps. Those who showed the least resistance to Communist Party policy were sent to labor camps called gulags, where prisoners were worked to death. s.70 (top) In the Stalinist era, millions of Russian citizens were loaded into trains and taken away. (Right) Industrial projects in the Soviet Union were carried out by the forced labor of prisoners. This photograph shows Uzbek children among those working under terrible conditions on the construction of the Fergana tunnel. s.71 What made Stalin become so merciless was the materialist philosophy he believed in. An unsmiling portrait of Marx hung in the office where he signed millions of death warrants. s.75 A MESSAGE OF FEAR TO SOCIETY: MASS EXECUTIONS In Stalin's era, prisoners were sometimes executed in public to send a message of fear to the people. This picture shows opponents of the regime, hanged by the secret police in a public square in 1946. s.77 SKULLS WITH BULLET HOLES Stalin's secret police carried out most executions secretly. These skulls, taken from a mass grave in Chelyabinsk, belong to people killed by a bullet in the head by Stalin's secret service (NKVD). You can see the bullet hole in the skull on the right. s.78 The Soviet Union brought Communism and brutality to occupied countries of the Eastern Bloc. Every movement against Moscow was repressed with bloody reprisals. After an independence movement sprang up in Czechoslovakia in the spring of 1968, the Red Army occupied the country. (Above) Soviet tanks in Prague during the occupation in August 1968. s.80 Cuba's Communist revolution, brought about by the combined efforts of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, is usually presented as a romantic episode in a heroic legend. But Communism brought only misery and torture to Cuba. s.83 In 1979, the Red Army occupied Afghanistan, putting into effect a brutal policy of genocide that took no account of women and children. Above, a so-called victory march by the Red Army in Moscow in 1984. s.86 COMMUNISM'S GOAL: TO BESTIALIZE HUMAN BEINGS Communists regard human beings as animals that must be controlled and believe that torture, starvation and intimidation are necessary to control the herd. This cruel ideology, an implementation of Darwinism, brought poor workers and peasants only more pain and cruelty than they had known under the Tsars. s.92 The cold faces of Lenin, Engels and Marx adorning important places in every Communist regime. s.95 Aleksander Rodchenko, a leader in \"Socialist Realism.\" s.96 A 1927 painting by Russian artist Aleksandr Deyneka entitled \"The Defense of Petrograd.\" s.97 Under Communism, art lost all esthetic meaning and turned into a mechanical means of propaganda. These drawings purport to depict the model person—a crude, strong, dull worker or peasant who thinks of nothing beyond obeying the system. s.98 Soviet propaganda posters from the 1920's: \"The Ten Commandments of the Proletariat\" and \"The Lie of International Imperialism.\" s.99 Communist leaders are always depicted with a cold, rigid and pitiless expression. These portraits of Lenin, drawn by Soviet artists, express Communism's dark spirit. s.100 An example of the \"anti-estheticism\" of Communist art, a work created in the 1920's by Soviet artist Vladimir Tatlin. Another example of Communist anti-estheticism: the depiction of a proletariat by a Soviet artist of that era. s.101 A propaganda poster for the Third Communist International, organized by the Soviet Union. The cold world of Communism is reflected on the face of the militant carrying the flag. s.103 Because Lysenko rejected the laws of genetics for the theory of evolution, Soviet agriculture remained backward for decades. s.104 Lysenko explains to Soviet experts the agricultural project based on \"proletarian science.\" Here, Lysenko's nonsense theories are explained in detail to Russian peasants who are forced to implement them. The result was a huge fiasco. s.106 Communism is a regime of fear. The people are continually intimidated by stern-faced uniformed officials looking down from above. s.107 The special Djzhernsky Unit, used to suppress public demonstrations in the Soviet Union. s.108 The eastern side of the Berlin wall before it was torn down. With its barbed wire, mines and tanks, the wall was a symbol of Communist despotism. s.111 THEY FELL VICTIM TO THE KGB KGB TACTICS INHERITED FROM THE SOVIETS s.114 One of the millions of victims of Mao's guerilla war. s.116 Chinese Communism developed and came to power with Stalin's support. But Red China's brutality was worse than Stalin's. s.119 Darwin, Huxley and Galton were three influential evolutionists who led some of the Chinese intellectuals to Fascism and Communism. s.120 Darwinism fostered Communism and Fascism in China. Fascist leader Chiang Kai-Shek was influenced by Darwinism. s.121 In China and Charles Darwin, Harvard University historian James Reeve Pusey explained that Darwinism had great influence in China and prepared the foundation for both Communist and Fascist ideas. s.124 A Chinese Communist propaganda poster. s.125 He inherited Darwinist ideology from Sun Yat-sen. After reading Darwin, Mao became an ardent Communist. s.126 After a bloody revolution, Mao announced the establishment of the People's Republic of China. s.127 A Red Chinese propaganda poster: Communist ideology—begun by Marx and Engels, continued by Lenin and Stalin—was finally taken over by Mao. What Marx and Engels actually transmitted to Lenin, Stalin, and Mao was Communism's \"well of bloodshed.\" Lenin and Stalin murdered 50 million people; Mao, 60 million. s.128 Mao's \"Great Leap Forward\" was a senseless, cruel project that paralyzed the county's agriculture and economy. Over 30 million died of starvation. In Hungry Ghosts: Mao's Secret Famine, Jasper Becker—who was the Beijing bureau chief of the South China Morning Post—gave a detailed account of the famine. s.129 In the years of the Great Leap, many Chinese who resisted Mao's savagery were brutally executed. Many were killed by a bullet to the back of the head. s.130 A Communist Party militant delivering Communist propaganda in the years of the Great Leap. s.132 A propaganda poster for the Great Leap depicts Mao as an agricultural genius in a rich field. However, Mao's reliance on and implementation of Lysenko's methods resulted in an agricultural disaster. s.137 The Cultural Revolution was a murderous frenzy designed to destroy every idea and every person opposed to Communist ideology. The propaganda poster on the right depicts this feast of bloodshed: anti-Communists being crushed by the fists of Red Communists. s.138 THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION: A MADNESS THAT TERRORIZED CHINA The Red Guards recognized Mao's Red Book as their only guide. During the Cultural Revolution, they overwhelmed the country with blood and fear. Propaganda posters also depicted the Red Guards' barbarism. In the poster at top, university professors, arrested and tortured by the Red Guards, are depicted as parasites that degenerate society. Young members of the Red Guards brainwashed by Mao's Communism. s.139 UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS BEING EXECUTED Throughout the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards tortured tens of thousands. University professors, statesmen, artists and writers were arrested, and publicly humiliated with insulting placards hung around their necks, before being executed. s.140 1 2 3 4 Another political execution in China: A woman named Wang Shouxin was arrested as an opponent of the regime, bound by soldiers, forced to her knees and killed with a single bullet. As a rule, the money to buy the bullet for executions like these was taken from the victim's family. 5 s.141 In Red China, political executions were everyday occurrences. Many were accused of \"not following Mao's way\" and executed in the streets. s.142 Another innocent Chinese executed during the Cultural Revolution. s.143 Propaganda posters showed Mao as the red sun rising over China. In reality, Maoism brought famine and torture and made China a Darwinist arena in which \"the weakest\" died. Mao murdered 60 million. On the right, a photograph of him in the last years before his death. s.144 International sources reported in detail China's brutality in eastern Turkestan.

Just gimme a call. Now, let's do some fishin'. Grab those poles over there. EXT. THE FISH PONDS - EARLY AFTERNOON They are walking by the pond with the fishing equipment. Larry is chewing on a half smoked cigar. A large school of fish churn the water near the bank. The school follows them as they walk along the edge of the pond. JACK Look at these guys. They look like piranha without the teeth. There's hundreds of them. LARRY Oh, they think they're getting fed. Every time you come near the pond they think its dinner time. JACK What do you feed them? LARRY Use ta be liver but that got expensive and messy, so now I use commercial food. Dried stuff. It's cleaner and cheaper. But they'll eat anything that you throw in there. Watch this. Larry throws his cigar butt into the pond and the fish devour it instantly. **LARRY** ** (CONT'D) ** See what I mean? Jack points to small holes dug into the bank of the pond on the other side of the pond. JACK What's all those holes? LARRY Rats! JACK Rats? LARRY Yeah, lots of rats are livin' by the ponds. They survive on the fish food that falls on the bank when I feed the fish. If I feed 'em and come back an hour later there ain't a scrap nowhere. The rats get is all clean as could be. They walk towards another pond. Larry points to the path and then to a chipper and a pile of wood chips alongside it. **LARRY** ** (CONT'D) ** Here, we gotta go this way. I got all my equipment blocking the road. Tryin' to clean the brush away from the bank over there so there's more fishin' room. That reminds me, I gotta call Ted. When I get a big pile, he comes down and picks 'em up. PETEY What's he do with them? LARRY Don't really know, I think landscaping. I know his son's in the business. I don't really care as long as he gets 'em out of here. JACK (laughing) Why don't you feed them to the fish? LARRY (laughing) Don't ya think I haven't thought about it? EXT. PETEY CAR - EARLY EVENING Jack and Petey are riding home after the day of fishing with Larry. JACK Wonder if I remember how to cook them? PETEY Nothin' to it. Larry already cleaned and filleted them for us. All you gotta do is put some butter in the pan and fry 'em up. And there you have it. A great fish dinner. JACK Yeah, Larry is a cool guy, kinda rough on the edges but cool. Man, he was really into guttin' those fish like he did. PETEY Sure is. He'd do anything to help you. You know when he was talkin' about the guns and comin' down and helpin' out, he wasn't shittin'. He'd do it. I was with him in Nam one time when he got into it with three guys. They beat the livin' shit out of him. Two days later, he came back with a bat and gave all three a good old ass kickin'. Larry never was no good at takin' shit from nobody. He didn't care who, what or where, he wasn't about to suck it down and he hasn't changed a bit. JACK What's with that big fuckin' scar on his cheek? PETEY He got shot by a Cong right through the cheek. The bullet went in one side and out the other and blasted out most of his back teeth on the way through. The way he tells it, he just spit 'em out and kept on shotin' and knowin' Larry the way I do, it's most probably true. EXT. JACK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING They pull up to Jack's apartment building. Police cars and an ambulance are in front with lights flashing. The front door is wide open and a stretcher is being carried out. CLOSE UP - JACK'S STUNNED STARE PETEY Somebody probably died and they're pickin' up the body. When you got a lotta old people livin' here ya gotta expect it. Happens all the time. Petey hands Jack a scrap of paper. **PETEY** ** (CONT'D) ** Jack, here's Larry's number. Remember you asked me for it before? Jack is speaking in a hollow, voice and still staring at the commotion in front of his building as he takes the note from Petey. JACK Thanks, Petey. Jack gets out of the car and starts to walk robotically towards the building. Petey pops the trunk lid and shouts to Jack. . PETEY Jack - get your fish out of the trunk. JACK Oh yeah, sure - thanks. Jack slowly turns and while still staring, goes to the trunk to get the fish. He then approaches the onlookers in front of the building. JACK What's going on? A BYSTANDER I think it's an old lady. JACK What about the old lady? BYSTANDER Think she had a heart attack. They found her in the hallway. Here, they're bringing her out now. Mrs. Murray is being carried on a stretcher to the ambulance. As they pass Jack he goes over to her. JACK Mrs. Murray! What happened? MRS. MURRAY I don't know Jack, I just passed out and the next thing I knew these men were here. They said I had a heart attack but I don't really remember. EMT Excuse me Sir. We've got to get her to the hospital. Jack is nudged out of the way by one of the EMTs. Jack speaks to the man in an excited voice. JACK Well how is she? EMT We think she's going to be okay but that's for the doctors to decide. JACK (Muttering sigh) Thank God. The ambulance doors close and it takes off down the street with sirens blaring. The crowd dissipates and Jack is left standing alone momentarily. He then suddenly begins walking hurriedly towards the apartment. INT. MRS. MURRAY'S APARTMENT - LATE EVENING Jack races into her apartment. The still broken door is held closed with a strip of duct tape. He enters and hurriedly checks the closet. The bag with the body is just as he left it. He slumps into a relaxed pose, closes the closet door and leaves the apartment. Chapter 6 House cleaning INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LATEr that EVENING Jack sits pensively for a few seconds. He then takes the paper scrap given to him by **PETEY** from his pocket. A few more seconds and he reluctantly reaches for the phone and dials. Intercutting between JACK and LARRY: JACK (on the phone) Hello Larry - this is Jack. LARRY (on the phone and laughing) What's the matter? Ya forget something or ya just wanta come back tomorrow for some more fishin'? JACK (on the phone) No Larry! I really did like it but that's not why I called. Remember this morning, when we were talking about our problem here and you said you'd help out if you could? Did you mean it? LARRY (on the phone) I don't never say nothin' I don't really mean unless I'm jokin' and that wasn't no joke. I hate to see anybody get abused by those shit bags, especially when their friends of mine that's bein' abused. JACK (on the phone) Well, I got this problem.. Jack begins to explain to Larry on the phone. TIME CUT: LARRY (on the phone) Okay then, I'll see you tomorrow if you can get Petey to drive you back up. Call me before you come so I can be sure I don't have any customers around and I can get everything ready. Jack hangs up the phone and calls Petey. JACK (on the phone) Petey, this is Jack. Can you do me a favor tomorrow, really two favors? PETEY (on the phone) Sure Jack. JACK (on the phone) First I need you to go down to the furniture store on Hastings Street and get an empty box - the biggest one that will fit in your trunk. I'm going to get rid of an old TV for the lady downstairs. I want you to help me carry it out. I want the box so just in case we drop it; the glass doesn't fly all over. Then we'll take it up to Larry. It still plays good and he said he'd be glad to have it. What do you think? PETEY (on the phone) Sure Jack, I'll be over tomorrow morning as soon as I get the box. EXT. FRONT OF JACK'S BUILDING - EARLY MORNING Petey is pointing to the box in the trunk of his car. PETEY Is this the kind you wanted? JACK Perfect! Jack hands Petey $5.

What happens when a culture's belief system is threatened, either from within or by outside pressure? We met Bruce E. Wexler, professor of psychiatry at Yale Medical School, and his book, _Brain and Culture: Neurobiology, Ideology, and Social Change_ a couple posts back. He's the guy who talked about...the importance of a close fit between internal neuropsychological structures created to conform with an individual's sensory and interpersonal environment at the time of development, and the environment in which the adult individual later finds him or herself. Wexler uses his brain-based cultural approach to explain _inter_ cultural conflict this way: This book argues that differences in belief systems can themselves occasion intercultural violence, since concordance between internal structure and external reality is a fundamental human neurobiological imperative. I.e., a culture resists change because its shared brain wiring is guarding its neurological peace of mind. Wexler's analysis also applies to _intra_ cultural conflict. And, as he further points out, ultimately the battle over culture is about whose brain wiring gets to make the rules. This argument thus provides a rational basis for the apparent fact that people fight not because of differences in religion and other beliefs; they fight to control the opportunity to create external structures that fit with their internal structures, and to prevent others from filling their environment with structures and stimulation that conflict with their internal structures. All of which explains why \"Sit Down You're Rockin' the Boat\"--i.e., resistance to cultural change--is _always_ an implied cultural norm. Challenges to a culture's belief system are _always_ perceived as a case of, The devil will drag you under by the sharp lapels of your checkered coat, So sit down, sit down, sit down you're rockin' the boat! From _Guys and Dolls_ ###The Culture of Law (7): _Cultural Evolution_ Our _Future of Law_ series earlier this year looked at internal and external trends creating pressure for change in the legal profession. But really...the law has been around for millennia; changes move through it glacially. Can't we just let things work themselves out in due time? Sure, of course. Culture is formed in the brain; it evolves there as well. Cultural evolution brings change slowly, eventually, and inevitably. There's just one problem: evolution of any kind doesn't work from a blueprint and doesn't sweat the small stuff, so you never know where it's going. The evolved architecture of the brain is haphazard and disjointed, and incorporates multiple systems, each of which has a mind of its own (so to speak). Evolution doesn't design things and it doesn't build systems--it _settles_ on systems that, historically, conveyed a survival benefit (and if a better way comes along, it will adopt that). There is no overarching grand planner engineering the systems so that they work harmoniously together. The brain is more like a big, old house with piecemeal renovations done on every floor, and less like new construction. The Organized Mind, by Daniel J. Levitin, Ph.D., Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Neuroscience, McGill University As a result, cultural evolution's adaptive walk might take us places contrary to our own best interests: Cultural evolution can yield significant change in behavior in the absence of biological evolution...Such changes need not be biologically adaptive; as a result, fads, fashions, or random variation, attitudes and behaviors may spread through a population that either have no effect on survival or that actually reduce the fitness of the members of a population. From _Evolution of Mind, Brain, and Culture, _ introduction by Gary Hatfield, Dept of Philosophy, University of Pennsylvania (Hmmm, did someone just say \"billable hour\"? Just couldn't resist....) If we'd prefer something other than an unpredictable evolutionary walk to potential self-destruction, we need to get proactive. Again from Dr. Levitin: A key to understanding the organized mind is to recognize that on its own, it doesn't organize things the way you might want it to. It comes preconfigured, and although it has enormous flexibility, it is built on a system that evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to deal with different kinds and different amounts of information that we have today. It's helpful to understand that our modes of thinking and decision-making evolved over the tens of thousands of years that humans lived as hunter-gatherers. Our genes haven't fully caught up with the demands of modern civilization, but fortunately human knowledge has--we now better understand how to overcome evolutionary limitations. This is the story of how humans have coped with information and organization from the beginning of civilization. It's also the story of how the most successful members of society \\--from successful artists, athletes, and warriors, to business executives and highly credentialed professionals--have learned to maximize their creativity, and efficiency, by organizing their lives so that they spend less time on the mundane, and more time on the inspiring, comforting, and rewarding things of life. Let's see...The most successful members of society, [including] highly credentialed professionals [such as lawyers], maximizing creativity and efficiency, spending less time on the mundane, and more time on the inspiring, comforting, and rewarding things of life.... That's the rationale for making the effort to overcome the limitations of evolutionary cultural change. Anybody up for it? ###The Culture of Law (8): _Bleak House and Epigenetics_ We looked last time at the slow pace and uncertain outcome of evolutionary cultural change. Just how slow is slow? How about no fundamental cultural change in the past 160 years? I'd say that's pretty slow. Law professor Benjamin H. Barton opens his recent new book _Glass Half Full: The Decline and Rebirth of the Legal Profession_ with these observations: Charles Dickens wrote _Bleak House_ as a serial in the 1850s and published it as a single volume in 1853. It is a blistering assessment of the English Chancery system and remains one of the most trenchant critiques of the common law system. Given the bewildering series of technological and societal changes over the last 160 years, there is something remarkable about Dickens's portrait of lawyers in Bleak House: it is utterly familiar to a modern reader. _Bleak House_ portrays a legal profession little changed from then to now. Dickens describes lawyers meeting in person with clients, or drafting papers, or investigating their cases. English lawyers in 1850 practiced an individualized and bespoke professional service that consisted of paying a lawyer for his time, sometimes in court, sometimes in consultation, sometimes in drafting documents or conducting research. If we want change faster than cultural evolution can give it to us, we might try analogizing to another scientific concept: epigenetics. David Perlmutter, neurologist and author of bestsellers _Brain Maker_ and _Grain Brain, _ describes epigenetics this way: Even though genes encoded by DNA are essentially static (barring the occurrence of mutation), the expression of those genes can be highly dynamic in response to environmental influences. This field of study, called epigenetics, is now one of the hottest areas of research. There are likely many windows during one's lifetime when we are sensitive to environmental impacts. Epigenetics, defined more technically, is the study of sections of your DNA (called \"marks\" or \"markers\") that essentially tell your genes when and how strongly to express themselves. [O] ur day-to-day lifestyle choices have a big effect on our biology and even the activity of our genes. Now that we have evidence to suggest that food, stress, exercise, sleep...affect which of our genes are activated and which remain suppressed, we can take some degree of control in all of these realms. Epigenetics explains why your kids aren't like you. They have your DNA, but the choices they make in their contemporary cultural context alternately activate or shut down certain aspects of their genetic coding. No paternity test needed; they're your kids alright, they've just been practicing epigenetics. By analogy, law students and lawyers who are \"sensitive to environmental impacts\"--either because their brains are still developing while they're in law school or because they're committed to cultural change--have the ability to turn off their _Bleak House_ cultural coding and embrace something new. And get this: radical cultural shift doesn't have to be driven only by technology, which was behind much of the change we looked at in the Future of Law series earlier this year. Instead, cultural change can be driven by \"day-to-day lifestyle choices\" involving things like \"food, stress, exercise, sleep.\" Think about that for a minute: lawyers committed to self-care could turn the whole institution and enterprise of law into a place of brand new vibrancy, creativity, and wellbeing. That's not pie-in-the-sky, that's epigenetics. In the next couple installments, we'll look at a topic where lawyers routinely choose historical cultural DNA over epigenetic change: their paychecks. ###The Culture of Law (9): _Show Me The Money_ If you saw _Jerry Maguire_, you remember the \"show me the money\" scene. Jerry has a moral epiphany, writes a middle-of-the-night manifesto, and hits the send button. He's greeted at the office with a rousing ovation...as one colleague asks another, \"How long do you give him?\" His manifesto broke with the cultural status quo; he has to go. He gets fired of course, and now he's dialing for dollars. He takes only one client with him, at the cost of everything he just gained from his awakening. It's funny, and if you've been there, painful. I had my own Show Me The Money Moment my first day back in the office after taking the bar exam. My wife and I had escaped for 3½ weeks in the Scottish highlands and islands. The silent remoteness and stark natural beauty were disorienting at first, but in time we settled into it and returned home resolute about creating a more enriching lifestyle. We flew back on a Saturday. On Monday morning I biked into work early, stopping to take photos of the downtown skyline and the Cathedral Basilica in the red light of the rising sun. At the office, the corporate department was in the middle of a merger on a fast track. I worked until 11:00 that night; I was the first to leave. Welcome back. Epiphanies are nice, but duty calls. There are clients to serve and paychecks to earn. Culture wins again. There were more epiphanies and more show me the money moments over the"], "id": "id61"}, "stats_key": {"light_scenario_key": {"scenario_spec": {"class_name":

{"instance": {"input": "John, \"You'll see.\" We'll see along with Mills and Sommerset. Mills, \"We're not just going to pick up two bodies. That wouldn't be shocking enough.\" John, \"Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder any more. You have to hit them with a sledge hammer.\" John feels that what he's doing is special, that it's his work. Mills tells John that nothing about this is special. Mills taunts him that people won't remember what's happened. John, \"People will barely be able to comprehend it, but they won't be able to deny it.\" Mills, \"You", "references": ["John, \"You'll see.\" We'll see along with Mills and Sommerset. Mills, \"We're not just going to pick up two bodies. That wouldn't be shocking enough.\" John, \"Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder any more. You have to hit them with a sledge hammer.\" John feels that what he's doing is special, that it's his work. Mills tells John that nothing about this is special. Mills taunts him that people won't remember what's happened. John, \"People will barely be able to comprehend it, but they won't be able to deny it.\" Mills, \"You be sure and let me know...because I don't want to miss it.\" John, \"Don't worry, you won't miss a thing.\" More brutally 'true' dialogue. They drive through an arid, barren area. Mills, \"When a person is insane...do you know that you're insane?\" John, \"It's not something I would expect you to accept...but I did not chose, I was chosen.\" Sommerset, \"You're overlooking a glaring contradiction.\" John, \"What?\" Sommerset, \"You enjoy torturing those people. Doesn't seem in keeping with martyrdom.\" John counters with the idea that he's no worse than Mills, who would hurt him given the opportunity. Mills denies this. Again, we have another powerful, brutal set up here. Mills, \"I thought all you were doing was killing innocent people?\" John, \"Is that supposed to be funny?\" He runs down the list of sinners and their sins and why they deserved to be tortured and killed. \"Only in a world this shitty could you even try and say these were innocent people and keep a straight face...We see a deadly sin on every street corner...We tolerate evil morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example. What I've done will be puzzled over, studied, and followed...forever.\" Mills, \"Delusions of grandeur.\" John, \"You should be thanking me. You'll be remembered after this.\" This sets us up to want to know what John is talking about? John and Mills get into an escalating verbal conflict until John says, \"I spared you...for the rest of what life I've allowed you to have.\" He's gotten to Mills. Mills, \"You're a fucking t-shirt...at best.\" John sees himself as an agent of God. The helicopter trailing the car has to rise higher to get away from some electrical pylons. They see a trailer in the distance and park nearby. It looks abandoned. Mills brings John out of the car. We \"see\" the scene from the helicopter, then back to the ground. This makes the point again about our being observers. John, \"What time is it?\" John leads them across a field. The question, where are they going? What will they find? The moment is shaped for drama. Sommerset sees a vehicle approaching. Sommerset returns to the car to intercept the approaching van. He forces it to a stop and tells Mills, \"Wait for my signal.\" He orders the guy out of the van. We see the scene from the helicopter. Guy, \"I have a package for a guy...David Mills.\" Sommerset gets the package. We see the box from the helicopter. They think it's a bomb. In a way, that's the truth. Sommerset tells the guy to leave on foot. He looks at the box. Cut to John looking at Mills. Sommerset, \"I'm going to open it.\" John, to Mills, \"When I said I admired you, I meant what I said.\" Sommerset uses his knife to open the box. When he opens it, he gasps. Then we view the scene from the helicopter. Then at Sommerset looking over at Mills holding the gun on John Doe. He backs away, saying, \"John Doe has the upper hand.\" Brilliant writing. How can it be true? He begins shouting at Mills to drop his gun, which confuses Mills. John Doe, \"I'm trying to tell you how much I admire you and your pretty wife.\" Mills, \"What you'd say?\" It comes out that John violated Tracy and took a souvenir, \"Her pretty head.\" It's Tracy's head in the box. Sommerset comes up and demands the gun. Mills, \"What's in the box.\" John, \"Envy is my sin.\" Sommerset, \"He wants you to shoot him.\" Mills, \"Tell me she's all right.\" Mills screams in agony. John, \"She begged for her life and for the life of the baby inside of her.\" This is a revelation for Mills. He looks down at John with his gun. John, \"He didn't know.\" Mills cries silently in anguish and keeps his gun pointed at John. Sommerset, \"If you kill him, he will win.\" What will Mills do? In this moment, we're being asked what we would do in his situation. The moment is drawn out. Then, Mills shoots John Doe. A plume of blood flies out from his body. We see the scene from the helicopter. Then, the POV from John's body as Mills stands over him and shoots him repeatedly. Sommerset cannot look at him. Sommerset walks away, seen from the helicopter. Man in helicopter, \"Somebody call somebody.\" There is no one to call. It's a profound statement about the underlying context of this story. By accepting this kind of action story, by letting ourselves into this kind of violent world, we now have a storyteller who forces us to confront our values about what we find entertaining. That's why at this moment, there's no one to call here. Next scene, Mills, in shock, in the back seat of a police car. Captain, \"Well take care of it.\" Mills is driven away. He is clearly out of his mind, in a profound state of shock. Sommerset, \"Whatever he needs.\" Captain, \"Where you gonna be?\" Sommerset, \"Around. I'll be around.\" As Sommerset and the Captain walk away, we have Sommerset's voice over. \"Hemmingway once wrote, 'The world is a fine place and worth fighting for.' (beat) I agree with the second part.\" Sommerset has been moved to have some of the feelings of Mills. This thoughtful man has been transformed by the action of the story. Again, _Seven_ is a rare thriller that pushes its audience into a place where they think about the action of the story. Whether this story was written through a process of intuition or a deep understanding of the craft of storytelling, it is a masterful piece of work. Every time I've spoken with others who've seen this film, a debate arises over the ending, whether Mills should have shot John Doe. Whether, even, Sommerset should have shot him instead. Or no one shot John Doe. It's part of the beauty of the film that it compels this debate. What would you do in this situation? The film makes you ask this question. It also asks you to think about the dark things that happen in our world and your personal response to them. Powerful, powerful work. A masterful example of the craft of storytelling, of an action film designed to not only move it audience to feel, but to think as well. ###Creating Story Movement by Traveling in Circles: A Review of Groundhog Day It is a principle of a well-told story that as a story unfolds, every event and character action should advance the story along its story line and plot line. A failure to introduce a story and advance it dramatically along its story line and plot line is a root cause of why so many struggling writers fail. Their stories fail to create a quality of dramatic advance that creates a \"moving\" experience for their audience. The film Groundhog Day offers a great example of how a story can advance along its story line even when its plot is, on the surface, a replay of the same events. By pointing out how this story moves forward while seeming to be going in circles, this underlying process of creating dramatic movement can be explored. The Review Groundhog Day opens with its credits appearing over a sky with moving clouds, signaling a passage of time. It quickly cuts to Phil, played by Bill Murray, a weatherman speaking to a blank blue wall while on a television, he appears to be looking at a weathermap. It comes out in this scene that Murray is an egocentric sort who will be spending the day in Punxsutawney, a town where Groundhog Day has been turned into a tradition and media event. The producer for this field shoot will be Rita (Andie McDowell), who is young and fresh compared to Murray's jaded persona. The dramatic purpose of this scene is to introduce Phil as a particular kind of obnoxious character who will be spending some time with the innocent, fresh Rita. The story question this introduction sets up is, can Phil and Rita get together? Obvious answer, no. But since this is a romantic comedy that intends to show how that answer can be turned to \"yes,\" these two characters are introduced to be naturally antagonistic...and spending the next few days together. The next series of scenes has Phil, Larry his shooter, and Rita in a van driving to Punxsutawney. By placing Rita and Phil in the van together, it becomes just how clear they are OPPOSITES with a mutual dislike. Rita is more than happy to stay at a cheap hotel as long as it means spending less time in the vicinity of Phil. To this point, the story has introduced Murray and his brand of humor contrasted with Rita's innocence, but it has also introduced these characters in a way that a core element of the story has come into view: if Phil and Rita are destined together, what must happen to bring this about? How do we (the audience) know they're destined to be together? By the way they were introduced. Phil comes awake on Groundhog day when an alarm clock flips over to 6 a.m. and the strains of \"I Got You, Babe\" by Sonny and Cher wake him. The song is followed by some local newscasters and their predictions about the weather. Phil walks to the park for his news report, meeting a variety of people. All seems typical. After giving his taped report of the events in the park, which predict six more weeks of winter, Phil, Rita and Larry head out of town."], "id": "id483"}, "stats_key": {"light_scenario_key":

We decided to send twenty brethren westward, to search out a location for the Saints; many eloquent speeches were made on the present position of affairs; had a good meeting, which continued all day. Brigham Young expressed a sense of urgency about the expedition. Various routes were discussed, based upon Captain Frémont's narrative and other sources. Finally, Brigham stood and said,\" Brethren, there's no time to dally. President Joseph Smith has informed me that if we don't mount this expedition right away, we'll never get another chance; our enemies will hem us in and we'll be used up in this place. \"You're all witnesses to the fact that Brother Joseph has talked about this movement for years. He's told me that he wants young men of faith for this party, men who can go upon the mountains of Israel and talk with God face to face as Moses did upon Mount Sinai, and learn just where he would have his people locate for their future welfare, and the kingdom's development. \"I realize that our able-bodied men are few in number now with the war and all, but surely we can spare twenty men for this expedition. Are you with me? All in favor, please manifest.\" The vote was unanimous in the affirmative. Several members of the committee considered it inadvisable for the expedition to head directly west across the Iowa Territory, due to the severe late winter weather. Brigham turned to Dimick Huntington and said,\" Brother Huntington, would it be possible to hire a steamboat to take us down the Mississippi and up the Missouri, to the Council Bluffs?\" \"Possible, but not likely\", said Dimick. \"There's a lot of ice on the river, an' no river pilot in his right mind is gonna venture out at this time of year. There's no boats to be had anyhow, since the army requisitioned them all for the war.\" \"What about the old Hyrum Smith?\" said Brigham. Dimick looked at him in disbelief. \"That hulk? Brigham, it's been under water for seven months! Everything above the hurricane deck is gone, used up for firewood. The hull's all rotten, and one of the steam engines is up at the temple. We'll have to chip through an inch of ice before we can even get down to the main deck.\" William Player spoke up. \"Ware all doone wi' th' stone work on t' temple, an' t'would be fair easy t' skid t' steam engine back doon th' brae. I'm sartain we could re-mount it on th' auld Hyrum.\" Bishop Miller said hopefully, \"The hull is still mostly sound, isn't it? We could 'fother' it with some of that canvas what the High Priests bought for to make a tabernacle. That should help stanch the leaks.\" Brigham thought for a moment and said,\" Brethren, I think this is a good plan. At any rate, it's the best we can do. I don't look forward to trudging across Iowa in the dead of winter. Missouri was bad enough, thank you.\" Dimick sighed. \"I s'pose we can refloat it...We'll need to find a lighter to carry our mules, wagons, and other tack, and tow it behind...It just might work. Anyway, the old scow only has to make it as far as the Council Bluffs, am I right?\" Brigham replied, \"And not a mile futher, I reckon. Oh, there's one final matter. In my absence, I don't want the Saints here in Nauvoo to be sitting on their lees, neither. Brother Joseph has instructed me to tell the Saints to have everything in readiness, upon my return from the west, in order to begin a full exodus from Nauvoo to the Upper California. As soon as the temple is completed, and we all take out our endowments, we shall leave this state and this nation, and find a place out west where no one can ever dig us out. Brethren, you've been putting up the temple for four years – now it's time to start putting up wagons.\" BEAUFORT, Saturday, February 15 On this day, the Army of the South commenced their breakout from Port Royal Island. North of Fort Lyttleton the island narrowed into a thin strip of land just five hundred feet wide, just south of Beaufort. The rebel Beaufort Volunteer Artillery Company had thrown up defensive fortifications on this narrow neck of land to protect the Beaufort Arsenal about two miles to the northeast on Beaufort Peninsula. Before the Army of the South could proceed, General Joseph Smith ordered a naval bombardment of the fortifications and of the arsenal, which was soon captured, yielding a great quantity of arms and ammunition. The rebel forces quickly fled in disarray. After the arsenal was secured, General Smith led his main cavalry force directly north and then west towards Battery Creek, hoping to prevent the rebels from reforming their defensive line. He was studiously following Roger's Rangers Rules, and had divided the Illinois 9th \"Mormon Battalion\" into three columns – left, center, and right. \"This whole region is a maze of creeks, channels, and estuaries, for ten miles or more – perfect for defensive positions\", he remarked to Lyman Wight. \"But if we press them hard enough, they shan't have time to dig in – I hope.\" Joseph had sent scouts ahead to reconnoiter, and they had not reported any contact with the enemy. At this point, the shoreline of Port Royal Island made a broad, sweeping curve to the west at the headwaters of the Battery Creek estuary. The tide had receded, revealing a vast expanse of salt marsh and mudflats. From this vantage Joseph could see the slave quarters of the Pick Pocket Plantation about a mile to the northwest. It looked quiet – too quiet. There were no slaves in sight, no activity in the cotton fields, in fact, no signs of life at all. \"I don't like the feel o' this\", Lyman Wight remarked. Just as Joseph was leading his center column into the muddy northern estuary of Battery Creek, all hell broke loose. A hail of musket fire erupted from the mangrove trees on the western side of the estuary, as Captain Alfred Barnwell's mounted Palmetto Hussars swept down from the cover of the plantation onto Joseph's lightly-armed right flank. Joseph quickly realized that if his right flank failed, he would soon be surrounded in the middle of the river – the most vulnerable of all positions for a soldier to fight from. \"Tell Tyler to hold the road at all costs!\" Joseph shouted to his orderly, James Allred. James cried, \"Aye, Sir! \", spurred his mount and galloped north to give the order to Captain Tyler's Company C, which was taking heavy fire on the right flank and falling back. The left flank had halted farther south at the edge of Battery Creek, which was too deep for them to ford at that point. Their \"flying artillery\" battery could not be brought to bear, as their commander was directly in the line of fire. It was up Joseph Smith and his center column, stranded in the middle of the river, to save the day. Joseph drew the Sword of Laban and cried, \"L'zikaron eloheynu! In memory of our God!\" Then he led his men in a desperate charge across the mudflats, directly into the entrenched rebel positions on the west side. He had no choice – to remain in the river would mean death, and his line of retreat was quickly being cut off. Joseph knew he had about twenty seconds at most before the rebels on the west bank had time to reload and fire another volley. \"Charge!\" he cried, and spurred his horse, Joe Duncan, in a desperate race against time. His cavalry troop followed him, thrashing and floundering across the coffee-colored salt estuary. Just as they reached the far bank the muskets erupted again, but with less effect this time. The sight of several score of mounted cavalrymen bearing down on the rebels had convinced many of them to abandon their positions and seek cover elsewhere. Joe Duncan made a tremendous leap over the rebel trenches, and Joseph felt several musket balls whiz past his head. As he laid into the enemy militiamen surrounding him with his sword, they retreated and fled deeper into the woods. \"Cheyruteynu u'shlomeynu! Our freedom and our peace!\" Joseph cried. His other officers had now joined him, and together they succeeded in clearing the west bank. Joseph paused to catch his breath, just in time to hear the bugle call \"To the Right\". He glanced over his shoulder to the north, and saw to his horror that his entire right flank had collapsed, as the rebel Palmetto Hussars were driving his infantrymen into the Battery Creek estuary. \"Sound 'Come About'!\" he cried, and his bugler made the call. Joseph led his weary troops back into the muddy tidewater in a furious counterattack. The two opposing troops collided mid-river in a thrashing, chaotic mêlée of horses and men. Joseph was not a skilled swordsman, but he quickly learned that although the enemy sabers could outreach him, he could easily parry and break them with his ancient Damascus steel broadsword. Joseph fought sword to sword with the rebel leader, Captain Barnwell. \"Git offa ma land!\" Barnwell cried as he lunged at Joseph, who dodged the blow and then broke Barnwell's saber at the hilt. \"Nasheynu v'tapeynu!\" Joseph replied. \"For our wives and our children!\" With his sword now reduced to a stub, Barnwell drew his pistol and fired at Joseph, but missed. The two men warily circled each other on their horses as the battle swirled around them. Barnwell suddenly unholstered his now-discharged carbine and swung the bayonet at Joseph's head, but Joseph avoided the blow and took another swipe at Barnwell with his sword. He missed, but the Sword of Laban struck deep into the horses' haunch. The horse reared up and the unfortunate captain was dumped into the muddy Battery Creek. \"I am not your enemy!\" Joseph cried. Barnwell stared back at him, dumbfounded. \"Th' hell you ain't!\" He jumped up and lunged at Joseph with his bayonet, but missed. Joseph kept his distance, as he knew Barnwell's bayonet could easily outreach his short sword. Finally he backed his horse up and charged Barnwell head on. Joe Duncan reared up on his hind legs and delivered a crushing blow"], "id": "id958"}, "stats_key": {"light_scenario_key": {"scenario_spec": {"class_name":

That's like the leaders of the atheist community where no one has been able to take down their argument on why God doesn't exist. That's why the Death Star is like a God Slayer. If the Sun in our solar system is God and the Sun is a Star, that's why a Death Star would be an invention designed to \"kill God.\" It's to kill the existence of God. That's exactly what the atheist community plans to do. They're intent on getting rid of God from society once and for all. Just look. They're frothing at the mouth like hungry dogs waiting for that final death blow. They want it. They can hardly wait. That's where you have me in my tiny little X-Wing flitting around dodging laser turrets and trying to keep ahead of Darth Vader closing in on me from behind. DARTH VADER: I have you now! Then out of nowhere the Han Solo in the Millennium Falcon take out Darth Vader and his wingmen. The Millennium Falcon is one variation of a God symbol taking out Darth Vader as another God symbol. Now, I'm going to translate this very slowly. It's going to be very long. Usually, when I do geometry proofs in Cryptology, I'll skip steps because I already know what the symbols are. However, since this is the first time for a lot of you to ever look at words as algebra equations, I'm going to do it the long way. In this case, I break down the word \"Millennium.\" Then I break down the world \"Falcon.\" Then I'll take Line 1, which was the original statement, and put it on the end to show how I got Line 23 through the conversions done in Lines 2 through 22. 1) Millennium Falcon = 5/29 F-AL/C-On 2) Millennium = 1,000 Years 3) 1,000 = M in Roman Numerals 4) M = 13th Letter 5) 13th Letter = 13th State 6) 13th State = Rhode Island 7) Rhode Island = 5/29 8) 5/29 = Peter Ware Higgs 9) Peter Ware Higgs = Higgs Boson 10) Higgs Boson = God Particle 11) God Particle = God 12) F = 6th Letter 13) 6th Letter = 6th Sign 14) 6th Sign = Virgo 15) Virgo = Virgin 16) AL = Aluminum 17) C = 3rd Letter 18) 3rd Letter = 3rd Sign 19) 3rd Sign = Gemini 20) Gemini = Sign of Communication 21) Sign of Communication = Communication 22) On = Activated 23) 5/29 F-AL/C-On = God Virgin AL Communication Activated So when you look at the word \"Millennium Falcon\" as an abbreviation, it means the God Virgin AL Communication Activated. In this volume, I point out where AL surfaces repeatedly throughout the \"Star Wars\" movie. If 5/29 is actor Sebastian Shaw as Darth Vader, Schmi Skywalker provided the Virgin birth as Darth Vader's mother, and this volume set has been activated to communicate this information. So that would be a mathematical \"Millennium Falcon.\" In virtual space or the way that Earth as a Super Computer would read the word \"Millennium Falcon, it is what it would imagine that line or operation to look like in a physical plane. If you know the story of the Millennium Falcon, they had to come up with a new design, which they referred to as a the Pork Burger. If you didn't know this already, the Millennium Falcon is modeled after a hamburger. The olive is the cockpit. The sound of the Millennium Falcon is based off of a McDonnell Douglas DC-9. It was introduced on 12/8 of 1965. The reason why I know that date is because it's my mom's birthday. Actor Sebastian Shaw is born 5/29 when Wisconsin became a state. The first approved Virgin Mother Apparition was approved on 12/8 of 2010 with the Shrine of Our Lady of Good Help. Governor Scott Walker), born 11/2 when North Dakota and South Dakota became states, defeated incumbent Tom Barrett) born 12/8 of 1953. Governor Scott Walker's Lieutenant Governor is [Redacted] Kleefisch. In this volume, I talk about how the name Redacted] is significant because the Queen of Alderaan was played by [[Redacted] Jackson Mendoza. So when you take Sebastian Shaw as Darth Vader born 5/29 aligning with the state of Wisconsin, the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 released on 12/8 of 1965 aligning with the Virgin Mary Apparition of 12/8 of 2010 as well as incumbent Tom Barrett born 12/8 of 1953, and [Redacted] Kleefisch aligning with [Redacted] Jackson Mendoza, that's bundled packets of information with number tags. The reason why I know it's correct is because I'm born 5/29, my mom is born 12/8, and I have friend named [Redacted] born 10/31 when Nevada became a state. Some skeptics will say that I'm just pulling random numbers. On top of that, you can't really verify that I'm born 5/29, that my mom is born 12/8, or that I have a friend named [Redacted]. You're just taking my word for it in print, which is true. However, once again, that's why I'll point out that this volume set is referred to as the \"Sunflower Diaries.\" They're called diaries because this is more of a personal account of what I've witnessed while studying cryptology over the last 8 years. So it softens the guidelines on whether what is written is taken as fact or just as a personal account based on the view of the author. It's up to the readership to determine how much of my content is true and how much is it is make believe. However, I would also suggest people read Volume 3. I have a section in there about \"make up\" symbolizing how people make things up or lie. The more you lie, the more \"make up\" have on. The people who tell the truth don't need much make-up. They have a natural beauty. Truth is beauty. Beauty is truth. I try to show that I have a very keen understanding of knowledge because I watch how the planet dispenses information. ##Chapter 5.8 Ewok and How to Play Dodge Bawl Another metaphor from \"Star Wars\" that can be used to explain the situation would be C-3PO able to communicate to the Ewoks in \"Star Wars: Episode 6 - Return of the Jedi.\" You're an Ewok. And of course, a lot of readers would wonder why they're being compared to short, furry little creatures. It's regarding the theme of intellectual age. Notice there's something called stunted growth. If you could translate Intelligence and Wisdom into a physical height and age, really young people symbolize inexperienced people while elderly folk represent those who are experienced. Physical age doesn't matter. Imagine a 40 year old who has never played Chess before competing against a 10 year old who is good at the game. The Intellectual age of the 40 year old would translate to a 5 year old or younger while the 10 year old as an experienced player would resemble that of a 30 year old. I'm assuming that most people who read my volume set on Cryptology don't know much about the field or only know it to a limited degree. That limitation would be stunted growth to the height of a furry Ewok if a professional Cryptologist symbolized the average height of a human being. So when I'm explaining Cryptology to you using analogies and metaphors you can understand, that's just like C-3PO who could speak 6 million different languages able to speak the language of the Ewoks. Just like C-3PO, I'm telling you that there's a war going on between the Scientific Community (Galactic Empire) and religious believers (Rebel Alliance). The Initials for Rebel Alliance are RA. The Egyptian Sun God was Ra. If the Sun is alive, it would be like God. Right now, the scientific community just like the Galactic Empire is about to deal the final blow proving that there is no God. The Shield Generator is what protects the Death Star. Until that Shield Generator is deactivated, the Rebel Alliance Fleet can't deal any damage to Death Star. The Death Star symbolizes the right arm of the scientific community that is wielding the finely honed axe, which symbolizes all the evidence that the scientific community has collected as their evidence proving why God doesn't exist. So far, the religious community hasn't been able to find any chink in the armor. Before I continue, let me explain why I'm temporarily helping the religious community make a case. It's not that I have a grudge against the atheist community. It's because the major problem with thinking that there is no God or no one above them is that they start to think they're at the top of the food chain. They start to think they're God. Not everyone is a good person. If we live in a world where there are bad people that aren't worried about any God figure existing that can put a stop to them or deal with them, that's how you start to see abusive behavior. They start treating others and those that they see inferior to them, which consists of animals and eve other people, badly Religious people will say that with all the gun violence and copycat killers, people need God or religion. Then scientific people or nonbelievers may not like the idea of religion, but I think the reasonable ones will concede that violence is escalating. Something needs to be done. It shouldn't have to require kids bringing bulletproof vests to school or people afraid to go to the local mall because there could be a shootout. I'm trying to show that there's a half-way solution that is a compromise for both the religious and scientific communities. By using Cryptology to prove that Earth is alive and like God, the religious community won't get verbally abused or branded as ignorant. The scientific community wins because they don't have to believe in God and can hash out their own interpretation of a living planet that can have traits like that of a God or a living organism that is ancient, wise, and old. It's where the religious and scientific communities can find some common ground and use that to cut down on gun violence and crime where innocent victims and good people are getting exploited and abused. So anyway, the story is that the scientific community is pretty much about to win and prove there is no God. That concept is the Death Star.

Lawrence Disguised as a cattle trader, Lieutenant Fletcher Taylor, now a prominent and wealthy citizen of Joplin, Mo., spent a week at the Eldridge house in Lawrence, Kansas, from which place had gone out the Jayhawkers who in three months just previous had slain 200 men and boys, taken many women prisoners, and stolen no one knows how many horses. At the house of Capt. Purdee on the Blackwater in Johnson county, 310 men answered August 16, 1863, to the summons of Capt. Quantrell to hear the report of Lieut. Taylor's reconnaissance. The lieutenant's report was encouraging. The city itself was poorly garrisoned; the camp beyond was not formidable; the streets were wide. \"You have heard the report,\" said Quantrell when the lieutenant finished. \"It is a long march; we march through soldiers; we attack soldiers; we must retreat through soldiers. What shall it be? Speak out. Anderson!\" \"Lawrence or hell,\" relied Anderson, instantly. With fire flashing in his eyes as he recalled the recent wreck from which his sister had been taken in Kansas City, he added: \"But with one proviso, that we kill every male thing.\" \"Todd?\" called Quantrell. \"Lawrence, if I knew that not a man would get back alive.\" \"Gregg?\" This was Capt. William Gregg, who still lives in Kansas City, one of the bravest men that ever faced powder, and in action the coolest, probably, in the entire command. William Gregg\" Lawrence,\" he relied. \"It is the home of Jim Lane; the nurse of Jayhawkers.\" \"Jarrette?\" \"Lawrence, by all means,\" my brother-in-law answered. \"It is the head devil of the killing and burning in Jackson county. I vote to fight it and with fire burn it before we leave.\" Shepherd, Dick Maddox, so on, Quantrell called the roll. \"Have you all voted?\" shouted Quantrell. There was no word. \"Then Lawrence it is; saddle up.\" We reached Lawrence the morning of the 21st. Quantrell sent me to quiz an old farmer who was feeding his hogs as to whether there had been any material changes in Lawrence since Lieut. Taylor had been there. He thought there were 75 soldiers in Lawrence; there were really 200. Four abreast, the column dashed into the town with the cry:\" The camp first!\" It was a day of butchery. Bill Anderson claimed to have killed fourteen and the count was allowed. But it is not true that women were killed. One negro woman leaned out of a window and shouted:\" You—of—.\" She toppled out dead before it was seen she was a woman. The death list that day is variously estimated at from 143 to 216 and the property loss by the firing of the town, the sacking of the bank, and the rest, at $1,500.000. Maj. John N. Edwards, in his Noted Guerrillas, says:\" Cole Younger saved at least a dozen lives this day. Indeed, he killed none save in open and manly battle. At one house he captured five citizens over whom he put a guard and at another three whom he defended and protected. The notorious Gen. James H. Lane, to get whom Quantrell would gladly have left and sacrificed all the balance of the victims, made his escape through a corn-field, hotly pursued but too splendidly mounted to be captured.\" My second lieutenant, Lon Railey, and a detachment gave Jim Lane a hot chase that day but in vain. When I joined Brother-in-law Jarrette's company, he said:\" Cole, your mother and your sister told me to take care of you.\" That day it was reversed. Coming out of Lawrence his horse was shot under him. He took the saddle off and tried to put it on a mustang that one of the boys was leading. Some of the boys say he had $8,000 in the saddle bags for the benefit of the widows and orphans of Missouri, but whether that is true or not I have no knowledge. While he was trying to saddle the mustang, he was nearly surrounded by the enemy. I dashed back and made him get up behind me. The saddle was left for the Kansas men. One of the treasures that we did bring out of Lawrence that day, however, was Jim Lane's \"black flag,\" with the inscription \"Presented to Gen. James H. Lane by the ladies of Leavenworth\". That is the only black flag that I knew anything about in connection with the Lawrence raid. Lawrence was followed by a feverish demand from the North for vengeance. Quantrell was to be hanged, drawn and quartered, his band annihilated; nothing was too terrible for his punishment. Four days after the raid, Gen. Thomas Ewing at St. Louis issued his celebrated General Order No. 11. This required that all persons living in Jackson, Cass and Bates counties, except one township, or within one mile of a military post, should remove within fifteen days. Those establishing their loyalty were permitted to go within the lines of any military post, or to Kansas, but all others were to remove without the bounds of the military district. All grain and hay in the proscribed district was to be turned into the military post before Sept. 9, and any grain or hay not so turned in was to be destroyed. It was the depopulation of western Missouri. Any citizen not within the limits of the military post after Sept. 9 was regarded as an outlaw. Pursued by 6,000 soldiers, the Confederates in that vicinity must ultimately rejoin their army farther south, but they harassed their pursuers for weeks in little bands rarely exceeding ten. The horrors of guerrilla warfare before the raid at Lawrence, were eclipsed after it. Scalping, for the first time, was resorted to. Andy Blunt found Ab. Haller's body, so mutilated, in the woods near Texas Prairie on the eastern edge of Jackson county. \"We had something to learn yet,\" said Blunt to his companions, \"and we have learned it. Scalp for scalp hereafter.\" Among the brave fighters who were participants in the fight at Lawrence were Tom Maupin, Dick Yager, Payne Jones, Frank Shepherd, Harrison Trow, Dick Burns, Andy McGuire and Ben Broomfield. * * * #15. Chasing Cotton Thieves In the fall of 1863, in the absence of Capt. Jarrette, who had rejoined Shelby's command, I became, at 19, captain of the company. Joe Lea was first lieutenant and Lon Railey second lieutenant. When Capt. Jarrette came north again, I again became lieutenant, but when Capts. Jarrette and Poole reported to Gen. Shelby on the Red river, they were sent into Louisiana, and I again became captain of the company, so reporting to Gen. Henry E. McCulloch in command of Northern Texas at Bonham. All my orders on the commissary and quartermaster's departments were signed by me as Capt. C.S.A. and duly honored. Around Bonham I did scout service for Gen. McCulloch, and in November he sent me with a very flattering letter to report to Gen. E. Kirby Smith, at Shreveport, Louisiana, the headquarters of the Trans-Mississippi department. Capts. Jarrette and Poole were at Shreveport and Gen. Smith gave us minute orders for a campaign against the cotton thieves and speculators who infested the Mississippi river bottom. An expedition to get rid of these was planned by Gen. Smith with Capt. Poole commanding one company, myself the other, and Capt. Jarrette over us both. Five miles from Tester's ferry on Bayou Macon we met a cotton train convoyed by 50 cavalry. We charged them on sight. The convoy got away with ten survivors, but every driver was shot, and four cotton buyers who were close behind in an ambulance were hung in a cotton gin near at hand. They had $180,000 on them, which, with the cotton and wagons, was sent back to Bastrop in charge of Lieut. Greenwood. A more exciting experience was mine at Bayou Monticello, a stream that was deeper than it looked. Observing a cotton train on a plantation across the bayou, I called to my men to follow me and plunged in. Seeing me floundering in the deep water, however, they went higher up to a bridge, and when I landed I found myself alone. I was hard pressed for a time, till they came up and relieved me. There were 52 soldiers killed here. Other charges near Goodrich's Landing and at Omega put an end to the cotton speculation in that locality. The Confederate army in that section was not well armed, and our company, each man with a pair of dragoon pistols and a Sharpe's rifle, was the envy of the Southern army. Gen. Kirby Smith told me he had not seen during the war a band so well armed. Consequently when, in February, 1864, Gen. Marmaduke sent to Gen. Shelby for an officer and 40 of the best mounted and best armed men he had, it was but natural that Shelby's adjutant-general, John N. Edwards, should recommend a part of the Missouri boys, and told me to select my men and report to Gen. Shelby, who in turn ordered me to report for special service to Gen. Marmaduke at Warren, Ark. Only twenty, and a beardless boy, Gen. Marmaduke looked me over rather dubiously, as I thought, but finally told me what he wanted—to find out whether or not it was true that Gen. Steele, at Little Rock, was preparing to move against Price at Camden, and to make the grand round of the picket posts from Warren to the Mississippi river, up the Arkansas to Pine Bluff and Little Rock, and returning by way of the western outpost at Hot Springs. We were to intercept all messages between Price and Marmaduke, and govern our movements by their contents. About half way between Pine Bluff and Little Rock we came up with a train of wagons, followed by an ambulance carrying several women and accompanied by mounted Federal soldiers. The soldiers got away into Pine Bluff, but we captured the"], "id": "id493"}, "stats_key": {"light_scenario_key": {"scenario_spec": {"class_name":

Antichrist is feminism, then confuses respect for the rights of women with the rivalry with the man encouraging them to compete for the same functions, this has led to an excessive drop in birth rates in countries where it is implanted in addition to making marriage ungovernable, do not understand that men and women have to be complementary, but without competing with each other, and without this being considered by one as superior to another. Antichrist is the one who seeks to deny the right to think or disagree, saying that what he says is the absolute truth, this is what is what many religions and sects to turn man into a mere instrument of other men. It's not the same religion apparatus religious, religion is an ideology, religious apparatus is a mechanism that seeks power trying to replace governments and therefore must disappear. There is no greater vileness that use religion as a cover to shelter evil, claim that they represent God, they are infallible and cannot be wrong it is blasphemous and therefore have become the seat of Satan. Because there is no better hostel for the devil that where not expect, i.e. in the ruling domes of religious organizations and sects, so it is in schools where they should teach moral principles and not elsewhere. Antichrist is homosexuality, because who has that behavior mocks nature, away from it rather than seek ways to recover the way. This is not to deny freedom of choice but to reject that option and not cooperating with her. Antichrist is vanity, how widespread is the earth and makes people believe that is beyond their means bringing them into error. Antichrist is the one who insults God, because there are people who believe in the right to judge him, as if they knew better than he what is true or false, these people are Satan who listens and is evil all there in his soul. People have to realize that this is the time when most difference between what seems true and what is true deceivers of the earth know that they have little time, and that man will end up realizing that the truth must be sought and not expected to serve it without any effort on your part. When man understands that freedom begins to start to doubt what you say and do not take anything for granted, you will have begun to these scammers and the beginning of a new era. FALSE PROPHETS Who are these false prophets of the Bible that tells us? False prophets are religious organizations and sects that stand between man and God, they try to monopolize what is true and what is not, seek to impose their will on the democratic decision of the citizens knowing being unfair, intended to state that what they say is God's church just because they are called. But the truth is not what it seems but what is, is not the cardinal suit makes a righteous man but his will. These organizations know that they have little time for when man understands that you do not need to communicate with God they will disappear, because no one has the right to proclaim God's representative, since it is blasphemy to be compared with him, and the pope of Catholic church did when he proclaimed himself infallible. The truth is that in the future such organizations no longer necessary because religious teachings will be in schools and the organizations that serve the supposed representation of God to get power illegally will have to disappear, because there is much difference between appearance and reality, and many try to benefit from this difference at the expense of citizens. Man does not need intermediaries to communicate with God because God is truth and light and it can be reached by oneself, it does not have to be anyone seeking to consider the alleged exclusive representation of God. It is necessary to protect especially those organizations who claim to be more religious than others but hide the evil in their midst, such as Islamic fundamentalists, who want to hand over political power to religious to create a dictatorship led by them. Also Jehovah's Witnesses, the Amish or extremist Jews. These organizations are run by domes formed by a small number of people who dictatorially intended to condition the lives of their followers, they do not care to do good, only interested in exercising power while maintaining backward customs and denying his followers right freedom of thought or action. are also false prophets many of the writers of the paranormal or spiritualism, because they pretend to be in contact with higher entities or aliens without being true, cause thereby discrediting those who tell the truth, they do not have the courage to defend their ideas openly leaving the reader to think and why they lie about the alleged contact, but those false contacted are easy to recognize because they only know how to say the words love, brotherhood, fraternity and love, fill books with many words actually they mean nothing, because never condemn the evils of the earth, never bring out the corrupt and those who seek to do evil in this world, because their real interest is the role and economic profit. there are those who use the opposite tactic showing the aliens as demonic beings allied with the governments of the earth, with this method cheat who also not willing to accept the existence of superior to them beings and only accept if presented as beings vulgar and evil. They do not realize that it is his vanity and his own ego that makes them think so, when they think of them that way it actually remember it is your own reflection in the mirror, do not understand that if aliens had wanted to invade land they had done thousands of years ago when the world was still very backward, I think something more can be expected of evolution. There are those who deny the existence of aliens saying that in such a case would have already openly declared to us, but why not do it is simple and do not consider the inhabitants of this world as valid interlocutors to talk with also them, is that the land is still undergoing a major process of evolution and its many prejudices prevent contact between equals, therefore it is prudent to wait for this world completes its evolution, intervening meanwhile indirectly, there keep in mind that the values that govern today is mere interest for power and money, however the evolved societies consider first the dignity and ethics. Some also claims that exist aliens governments of the earth and would have confirmed, but the real reason not to do is the simple shame, because it is quite embarrassing to recognize that these unidentified flying objects fly over every day heaven of our planet without anyone being able to stop them. Another feature of these false prophets is to try to scare people arguing the end of the world, with the intention that they do not realize that the real danger they have ahead and it is those charlatans who are scared to take away the money, common feature is that they put dates to the supposed end of the world. To my mind there will be no such end but a transformation of humanity that becomes a developed society. Arguably evil philosophy is that you can find arguments to defend any theory however absurd it may be, this live quacks who cheat to get money, they use half-truths to cause confusion, so those seeking really have to act as if within themselves have two people predisposed to believe and another skeptic, is in this debate as is the truth. I would also like to mention here so many writers of classical literature who feign a false humility in order to get rewards and recognition they do not deserve, as is generally characterized by a superficial literature. THE FIRST CHURCHES At first, the temples were used as places of worship to idols and people came to them to do or leave offerings to its many imaginary gods, the temple therefore to the role of alleged house of their god represented by a series of dolls which they stood in a prominent place of it and people could visit as if it were a neighbor over town. Subsequently, the temples addition to being used for the worship of idols began to be used for recitation of religious books, the Catholic Church for example replaced idols by Christs, virgins and saints really are idols exactly like the previous because the true definition of monotheism is that there is only one God and God alone is to be worshiped, this means that the installation of dolls in churches, whatever they are, is a clear throwback to the past, and the reason it is the obsessive desire for the church not to lose their power. Because an evolved society does not need temples, as the true temple of God is the heart of the righteous, because God has no home because it is everywhere. An evolved society does not need temples, because the teaching of religion is in schools or academies established for this where you have to teach. Religion must merge with society and taught with other subjects and not be a hostage of religious organizations who only seek power for themselves, because it is not the same religion religious organization, religion is a way of thinking and a philosophy, religious organization is a company that intends to use religion to gain power and money. They also try to make us believe that temples are necessary for performing rituals like baptism or communion scare people by saying that if they do not their children will be condemned to hell, but such a thing is absurd, because baptism is no more an unnecessary at present mere ritual, and in any case do not make sense to minors, but is done in order to impose submission to their religion before they can remember. The truth is that rituals are not necessary, but religious organizations try to use them in order to force citizens to go to the temples and thus exert power over them. With the disappearance of the temples also disappear these organizations and finally the man will be free to communicate with God without intermediaries seeking to tell what the divine will. THE NATURE OF A PROPHET What qualities and circumstances make a philosopher or a prophet differ from most people? In my opinion is the sum of different factors. The first is arguably the opportunity, because in order to develop a complex form a philosophical idea or a scientific theory is necessary to have time to make possible a rigorous and thorough analysis that allows to achieve a minimally drawn conclusions, that is a philosopher you need to distance himself enough from the usual life events so that you are able to concentrate on their"],

Terrible news! _Lindisfarne has been_ _destroyed by barbarians from the North_. God's righteous wrath, once felt by the wretched and proud sinners of Sodom and Gomorrah, has inexplicably extinguished a humble community devoted to praising and obeying Him. Why? In my pain and confusion, that question never departs. Why? Without cease, I beg God--who is so high above us, yet stoops to hear the cries of the lowly--to answer: _O, why? _ I seek understanding in the words of Holy Scripture: \"Many are the afflictions of the righteous man, but the Lord shall deliver him from them all.\" I read and read again: \"It is through tribulations that we may enter of the Kingdom of God, so let us rejoice in our tribulations.\" Yet, how can I rejoice that heathens have desecrated God's sanctuaries with slaughter and outrage, poured the blood of Saints around the altar, burned the house of our hope, trampled on the bodies of Saints in God's temple like animal dung in the street. My heart aches to remember my martyred sisters--brutally, mercilessly butchered; or dragged in chains, naked and loaded with insults, to the ships of the north-men; or drowned in attempting to escape the island; or, most tragically, driven to the sin of suicide. The north-men came like stinging hornets and spread on all sides like fearful wolves, robbing, violating, committing sacrilege everywhere, ripping and slaughtering my flock of virgin scholars! Alcuin--behold with pity and tears the shrine of Saint Cuthbert, spattered with the blood of the brides of God, stripped of its ornaments, trampled by the polluted steps of pagan fiends, within fire-black walls once graced by Northumbria's finest art! A place more venerable than all in England was the prey of pagan wretches. It has been nearly 350 years that we and our ancestors have inhabited England, and never before has such terror appeared here as we have now suffered, nor was it ever imagined that such an attack from the sea could be made. Despite the distress and disorder of my mind, I owe you a duty to describe in this letter all I witnessed; perhaps you can find a meaning in these miserable events, which seem so senseless. On the evening of June 8--a date of infamy which shall, surely, be never forgotten--terrible portents were seen all over Northumbria, miserably frightening the people: whirlwinds swirled across the land, immense sheets of lightning filled the skies, and fiery dragons were seen flying in the air. (So many credible people have reported these sinister signs that they ought not be dismissed as superstition, but as unheeded warnings from Heaven.) Blind to the approaching danger, we went through our accustomed routines; after final Mass, I made sure that all the nuns were in the dormitorium, and then proceeded with my assistant, Sister Wilthburga, to my office and sleeping-chamber. During the third hour of the night, I was awoken by Sister Wilthburga, who informed me that she had seen men outside. At the window, I saw that she was correct--O, what horror, watching hundreds of strangers, each bearing flame, scrambling over the convent walls! These were obviously not troops of King Aethelred, or of any Northumbrian knight--their weapons and clothes were so strange and crude, that I have never before seen the like--some of the pagans actually wore helmets with horns sticking up, as if to imitate the Devil! There were hundreds (if not thousands) of pagan warriors with torches and weapons, running at the home of Saint Cuthbert! Resisting panic, Sister Wilthburga and I searched our bed-chamber for the alarm-bell. We had never had a need to use it before, and I confess to my shame and regret that I could not remember where I had put it. We searched for it frantically, until Sister Wilthburga located the bell under a pile of manuscripts. (Tetta the hypocrite--for I had lectured my nuns many times about the virtues of tidiness and order! Alcuin, I hope that you may never learn to despise me.) By this time, the invaders had already penetrated the sanctity of Cuthbert's temple. I stuck my arm out the window and started ringing the bell. When Sister Wilthburga observed that a group of the pagans was approaching our building, I stopped ringing it. Hearing the sound of weapons striking at the door to my office, Sister Wilthburga and I slipped fruit-knives into our stockings and climbed out the bedroom window and hid in the bushes beneath. Seeing that all of the attackers had left the area of the church, Sister Wilthburga and I ran from shadow to shadow towards it. Not daring to enter by the front doors, which were in clear view of the courtyard and most of the other buildings, we slipped inside through the side chapel-door. Two items needed to be secured, at any cost, from the unholy hands of pagans: the Gospels of Saint Cuthbert, and his remains. Silver and gold ornaments may be replaced; domestic and scholastic supplies may be replenished; even the lives of nuns, each so precious and pure, were of infinitely less worth than those sacred items from our Church's earliest history. Except for a single candlestick taken from the altar, we found that nothing in the church had been looted--yet. It was an instant to take up the gospel-book, but rescuing Saint Cuthbert was a challenge--sliding the stone slab from the top of his crypt was normally a job for six nuns, and we were only two. Yet the feeble arms of elderly women, for a moment, gained the strength of Samson, and we were able to wrench the heavy slab away. Our strength was further tested, in reaching down into the crypt to grip the famous casket and lift it out. Sister Wilthburga urged that we hide. But I guessed--correctly, it proved--that the invaders would search every building in the convent for valuables, and then set them all afire. We had to flee. With the gospel-book hidden inside my shirt, both of my hands could grip the ancient pine-wood casket. It was surprisingly light, and I suspect that the spirit of Saint Cuthbert himself miraculously assisted us. At the side chapel-door, we saw only a few of the pagan warriors outside, and they were far enough away that we might slip out unobserved. We carried the relics from shadow to shadow, and reached one of the gates of the convent wall. We had to put Saint Cuthbert onto the ground, as we opened the latch. A barbarous shout from behind us. We had been seen. Pagans ran after us! I welcomed death, as a passage to Paradise. No, the fear that struck me then was not for my own personal safety, but for that of our precious burden. I had devoted my life to preserving Saint Cuthbert's holy remains and studying the exquisite painted pages of his Gospel. It was fear of their pollution at the hands of pagans that filled my soul with panic and my body with a desperate energy! We ran through the gate, bearing Cuthbert's ancient coffin as if it weighed less than a basket of dry laundry. We fled with our Saint, along a trail to the beach, hearing the fearsome sounds of pursuit behind. Barbarous yells and curses filled the dark forest! (The north-men use a language like English, but with strange pronunciation and an ugly, harsh accept. Some words were completely foreign, but I could understand most of their speech. Some barbarians were heard referring to a home-land \"back in the North\". I have never seen men of this kind before. Most were blonde-haired and pale of skin, but others were darker than Beelzebub. Alcuin, is it possible that these people were Germans?) We reached the beach, heading toward the dock and the fishing-boats. But soon after we left the shadows of the forest, our pursuers burst out after us. \"We have to drop the Saint!\" Wilthburga cried. \"He's slowing us down.\" I said, \"Never! Have faith in the Lord!\" And so we ran, hoping for a miracle to save us, until Sister Wilthburga (who was behind me, holding the foot of the casket) was seized from behind. She dropped her end of the casket to the beach-sand and--I shudder to remember!--the sacred container broke open, spilling Saint Cuthbert's desiccated legs and hips onto the beach sand! The sacred bones and clothing-shreds of the first evangelist to England, dumped onto the sand and sea-shells before my very eyes! With one hand, I clutched the Gospels concealed under my shirt, and with the other, I pulled the knife from my stocking and held it to my nose. I had remembered the example of Saint Agatha; like her, I was willing to spoil the superficial appearance of my face, to discourage forcible ravishment. Surrounded by seven or eight of the armed pagans, my attention was captured by their leader--O, Christ and Mary and the Apostles, that I never see such a man again! If it was even a man, not a devil. He wore a helmet with terrifying horns, and like the other invaders, crude purple make-up was barbarously applied around his cruel eyes. Most shocking of all \\--the skin of his face and body was as _black_ as the accursed hide of Lucifer, and hair hung from his head like the twisted tresses of Medusa! Was this creature a man or a devil? To this day, I cannot decide. Devils or men, there is no doubt that they were all inspired by the Fallen Arch-Fiend of Darkness. They hurled Sister Wilthburga roughly to the sand, snatching away the unused knife in her stocking. \"Leave us!\" I commanded. \""], "id": "id338"}, "stats_key": {"light_scenario_key":

Copyright (C) Libreria Editrice Vaticana (vatican.va) VATICAN NEWS **Pope to ambassadors: Work for peace amid 'complex' global conflicts** _by Elise Harris (CNA/EWTN News) • May 18, 2017_ Pope Francis speaks to the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Holy See on Jan. 11, 2015. (L'Osservatore Romano) **Vatican City**--On Thursday Pope Francis received the credentials of six new ambassadors to the Holy See, telling them to work for the common good and support peace efforts that lessen tensions given the complexity of the global climate. \"The international scene is at present marked by great complexity, nor is it free of dark clouds,\" the Pope said May 18. This situation, he added, requires \"a greater awareness of the approaches and actions needed to pursue the path of peace and to lessen tensions.\" Francis spoke to ambassadors Ms. Zhanar Aitzhan of Kazakhstan; Ms. Aichetou Mint M'Haiham of Mauritania; Mr. Ramesh Prasad Khanal of Nepal; Mr. Boubacar Boureima of Niger; Mr. Daffa-Alla Elhag Ali Osman of Sudan and Mr. Colin Michael Connelly of Trinidad and Tobago. He asked them to convey his respect to their respective heads of State, and offered a special greeting to M'Haiham, who is Mauritania's first ambassador to the Holy See. In his brief speech, the Pope said there are several factors that aggravate the problems that exist on the global stage, the first of which is \"an economic and financial system that, rather than being at the service of people, is set up principally to serve itself and to evade oversight by public authorities.\" These authorities are responsible for the common good, \"yet they lack the means necessary to moderate the disproportionate appetites of the few,\" he said, noting that there seems to be an increasing impulse toward violence. In many ways, there is \"a greater readiness to have recourse to force,\" he said, \"not as a last resort but practically as one means among many, ready to be used without a full consideration of its consequences.\" Another factor exacerbating current conflicts is \"fundamentalism,\" the Pope said, pointing specifically to \"the abuse of religion to justify a thirst for power\" and the \"manipulation of God's holy name to advance by any means possible one's own plans to gain power.\" Turning to the task the ambassadors themselves will face, Francis said the response to these \"distortions\" and the risks they pose to promoting peace must be the creation of \"a responsible economic and financial system\" that is responsive to the needs of both individuals and their communities. \"Men and women, not money, must once more become the goal of the economy!\" he said, urging the diplomats to face differences with \"the courageous patience of dialogue and diplomacy, with initiatives of encounter and peace, and not with shows of force and its hasty and ill-advised use.\" Likewise, Pope Francis also stressed the importance of isolating those \"who seek to turn a religious affiliation or identity into a motive of hate for all others.\" \"Those who befoul the image of God in this way need to be confronted by a concerted commitment to demonstrating that those who honor God's name save lives, not take them,\" he said. If we move more decisively in the direction of peace, mercy and compassion rather than division, war and indifference, then \"the cause of peace and justice - the conditions of a balanced development for all - will make tangible progress,\" he said. Francis then offered his personal greetings to the Catholic population in each of the six countries represented by the ambassadors, and assured the diplomats of the constant support of the Roman Curia in fulfilling their duties. **Share this article** Original article with sharing options: Link VATICAN NEWS **Audience dedicated to sufferers of Huntington's Chorea** _The Holy See Press Office • May 18, 2017_ **Vatican City**--At 11:30 this morning, in the Paul VI Hall, the Holy Father Francis received in audience people affected by Huntington's chorea, accompanied by family members. The encounter, dedicated to Huntington's disease, in solidarity with South America where it is more widespread, took as its theme: _Hidden No More (Oculta Nunca M as, Mai Piu Nascosta) _. The following is the full text of the Pope's address to those present. **Address of the Holy Father** Dear brothers and sisters, I welcome you with joy, and I greet each one of you present at this opportunity for meeting and reflection dedicated to Huntington's Disease. I wholeheartedly thank all those who worked to make this day possible. I am grateful to Dr. Cattaneo and to Mr. Sabine for their introductory words. I would like to extend my greeting to all people who, in their body and in their life, carry signs of this disease, as well as those who suffer from other so-called rare diseases. I know that some of you have had to brave a very long and difficult journey in order to be here today. I thank you and I am happy you are here. I have listened to your accounts and the difficulties you must face each day; I understand how much tenacity and dedication your families, doctors, health care workers and volunteers have as they support you in a journey that poses many uphill climbs, some of which are extremely difficult. For far too long. the fears and difficulties that characterize the life of people affected by Huntington's Disease have surrounded them with misunderstandings and barriers, veritably excluding them. In many cases the sick and their families have experienced the tragedy of shame, isolation and abandonment. Today, however, we are here because we want to say to ourselves and all the world: \"HIDDEN NO MORE!,\" \"OCULTA NUNCA MAS!,\" \"MAI PIU' NASCOSTA! .\" It is not simply a slogan, so much as a commitment that we all must foster. The strength and conviction with which we pronounce these words derive precisely from what Jesus himself taught us. Throughout his ministry, he met many sick people; he took on their suffering; he tore down the walls of stigma and of marginalization that prevented so many of them from feeling respected and loved. For Jesus, disease is never an obstacle to encountering people, but rather, the contrary. He taught us that the human person is always precious, always endowed with a dignity that nothing and no one can erase, not even disease. Fragility is not an ill. And disease, which is an expression of fragility, cannot and must not make us forget that in the eyes of God our value is always priceless. Disease can also be an opportunity for encounter, for sharing, for solidarity. The sick people who encountered Jesus were restored above all by this awareness. They felt they were listened to, respected, loved. May none of you ever feel you are alone; may none of you feel you are a burden; may no one feel the need to run away. You are precious in the eyes of God; you are precious in the eyes of the Church! I now turn to the families. Those who experience Huntington's Disease know that no one can really overcome loneliness and despair if they do not have people at their side who, with self-sacrifice and steadfastness, make themselves 'travel companions.' You are all this: fathers, mothers, husbands, wives, children, brothers and sisters who, on a daily basis, silently but effectively, accompany your family members on this difficult path. For you, too, at times, the path is an uphill climb. For this reason, I encourage you, too, not to feel you are alone; not to give in to the temptation of the sense of shame or guilt. The family is the privileged place of life and of dignity, and you can cooperate to build that network of solidarity and of help that the family alone can guarantee, and which the family is first called to live. I speak to you, physicians, health care workers, volunteers of the associations that are involved with Huntington's Disease and with those who suffer from it. Among you there are also workers from the Ospedale Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, who, both with assistance and with research, express the contribution of a work of the Holy See in this most important field. The service that you all provide is valuable, because it is surely your dedication and your initiative that give tangible shape to the hope and motivation of the families who trust in you. The disease poses many challenges related to diagnostics, therapy and assistance. May the Lord bless your work: may you be a point of reference for patients and their families who, in various circumstances, find themselves having to face the already difficult trials that the disease entails, in a social-health care context which often is not oriented to the dignity of the human person. In this way, however, difficulties multiply. Often adding to the disease are poverty, forced separations and a general sense of dismay and mistrust. For this reason, national and international associations and institutions are vital. You are like hands that God uses to sow hope. You are the voices that these people have so as to claim their rights! Lastly, geneticists and scientists are present here, who, for some time, sparing no energy, have dedicated themselves to studying and researching a treatment for Huntington's Disease. Clearly, there is a great deal of expectation surrounding your work: resting on your efforts are the hopes of finding the way to a definitive cure for the disease, but also of improving the living conditions of these brothers and sisters, and of accompaniment, especially in the delicate phases of diagnosis, at the onset of the first symptoms. May the Lord bless your task! I encourage you to always pursue it with means that do not contribute to fueling that \"throw-away culture\" that at times infiltrates even the world of scientific research. Some branches of research, in fact, utilize human embryos, inevitably causing their destruction. But we know that no ends, even noble in themselves, such as a predicted utility for science, for other human beings or for society, can justify the destruction of human embryos. Brothers and sisters, as you see, you are a large and motivated community. May the life of each of you--both of those who are directly affected by Huntington's Disease and those who work hard every day to support the sick in their pain and difficulty--be a living witness to the hope that Christ has given us. Even through suffering there passes a path of abundant good, which we"], "id": "id720"}, "stats_key": {"light_scenario_key": {"scenario_spec": {"class_name":
